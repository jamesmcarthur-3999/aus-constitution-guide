# Landmark High Court Cases on the Australian Constitution

This document provides summaries of the most significant High Court cases that have shaped the interpretation of the Australian Constitution.

## Foundational Cases

### Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (1920) ["Engineers' Case"]
**Citation:** 28 CLR 129; [1920] HCA 54

**Constitutional Sections:** Section 51 (various powers)

**Summary:** This landmark decision fundamentally changed how the Constitution is interpreted. It rejected previous approaches to constitutional interpretation, including the "implied intergovernmental immunities" doctrine and the "reserved state powers" doctrine.

**Impact:** The High Court held that the Constitution should be interpreted according to its natural meaning, without presuming limitations on Commonwealth power. This case established the modern basis for understanding federalism in Australia and significantly expanded Commonwealth power relative to the states.

### Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth (1951) ["Communist Party Case"]
**Citation:** 83 CLR 1; [1951] HCA 5

**Constitutional Sections:** Section 51(vi) (defense power), Section 51(xxxix) (incidental power)

**Summary:** The High Court struck down the Communist Party Dissolution Act 1950, which had declared the Australian Communist Party illegal and allowed for the seizure of its property.

**Impact:** This case was crucially important for establishing that Parliament cannot simply "recite itself into power" by declaring something to be a threat to national security. It reinforced the role of the High Court as the ultimate arbiter of constitutional validity and protected political freedoms even during the Cold War.

## Constitutional Rights and Freedoms

### Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth (1992)
**Citation:** 177 CLR 106; [1992] HCA 45

**Constitutional Sections:** Sections 7 and 24 (representation in Parliament)

**Summary:** This case established that although the Constitution does not explicitly protect freedom of political communication, such a freedom is implied by the system of representative government established by the Constitution.

**Impact:** The High Court found that sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution (requiring parliamentarians to be "directly chosen by the people") necessitate a freedom of political communication to ensure voters can make an informed choice. This created one of the few implied rights in the Constitution.

### Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997)
**Citation:** 189 CLR 520; [1997] HCA 25

**Constitutional Sections:** Implied freedom of political communication

**Summary:** This case refined the test for determining whether a law infringes the implied freedom of political communication established in ACTV v Commonwealth.

**Impact:** The High Court established a two-part test to determine whether a law infringes the implied freedom: (1) Does the law effectively burden freedom of communication about government or political matters? (2) If so, is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end in a manner compatible with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative government?

## Federalism and Commonwealth Powers

### Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) ["Tasmanian Dam Case"]
**Citation:** 158 CLR 1; [1983] HCA 21

**Constitutional Sections:** Section 51(xxix) (external affairs power)

**Summary:** The Commonwealth used its external affairs power to stop Tasmania from building a dam on the Gordon River, based on Australia's international obligations under the World Heritage Convention.

**Impact:** The case dramatically expanded the Commonwealth's ability to use the external affairs power to legislate on matters traditionally under state jurisdiction, so long as the legislation implements an international treaty. This has been one of the most significant expansions of Commonwealth power since federation.

### New South Wales v Commonwealth (2006) ["Work Choices Case"]
**Citation:** 229 CLR 1; [2006] HCA 52

**Constitutional Sections:** Section 51(xx) (corporations power)

**Summary:** The High Court upheld the validity of the Commonwealth's Work Choices industrial relations legislation, which relied primarily on the corporations power rather than the conciliation and arbitration power traditionally used for industrial relations.

**Impact:** This decision significantly expanded the scope of the corporations power, allowing the Commonwealth to regulate many aspects of corporate activity that were previously considered state matters. It confirmed the capacity of the Commonwealth to regulate the activities of corporations directly, rather than only through the more limited industrial arbitration power.

## Indigenous Rights

### Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)
**Citation:** 175 CLR 1; [1992] HCA 23

**Constitutional Sections:** Not primarily a constitutional case, but had constitutional implications

**Summary:** The High Court recognized the concept of native title in Australia for the first time, rejecting the doctrine of terra nullius (the idea that Australia was legally unoccupied before European settlement).

**Impact:** While not primarily a constitutional case, Mabo had profound implications for Australian law and society. It led to the Native Title Act 1993 and established that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' rights to land according to their traditional laws and customs had survived British colonization.

### Kartinyeri v Commonwealth (1998) ["Hindmarsh Island Bridge Case"]
**Citation:** 195 CLR 337; [1998] HCA 22

**Constitutional Sections:** Section 51(xxvi) (race power)

**Summary:** This case concerned whether the "race power" in section, which allows the Commonwealth to make special laws for people of any race, could be used to make laws that disadvantage particular races.

**Impact:** The High Court was divided on whether the race power could only be used beneficially or could also be used to the detriment of particular races. This ambiguity remains unresolved in Australian constitutional law.

## Separation of Powers

### R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia (1956) ["Boilermakers' Case"]
**Citation:** 94 CLR 254; [1956] HCA 10

**Constitutional Sections:** Chapter III (The Judicature)

**Summary:** The High Court established the strict separation of judicial power in Australia, ruling that bodies exercising federal judicial power cannot exercise non-judicial powers, and bodies exercising non-judicial powers cannot exercise federal judicial power.

**Impact:** This case reinforced the independence of the judiciary and established a stricter separation of powers in Australia than exists in some other Westminster-style systems. It has had ongoing implications for the design of federal tribunals and regulatory bodies.

### Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003)
**Citation:** 211 CLR 476; [2003] HCA 2

**Constitutional Sections:** Section 75(v) (original jurisdiction of the High Court)

**Summary:** This case concerned the constitutional entrenchment of judicial review of executive action, particularly in the context of migration decisions.

**Impact:** The High Court held that section 75(v) of the Constitution, which gives the High Court original jurisdiction to issue writs against Commonwealth officers, cannot be removed by Parliament. This ensures that there is always judicial oversight of government action, reinforcing the rule of law and the separation of powers.

## Constitutional Structure and Amendment

### Sue v Hill (1999)
**Citation:** 199 CLR 462; [1999] HCA 30

**Constitutional Sections:** Section 44(i) (disqualification of members of Parliament)

**Summary:** The High Court found that the United Kingdom is a "foreign power" for the purposes of section 44(i) of the Constitution, which disqualifies people with allegiance to a foreign power from being members of Parliament.

**Impact:** This decision confirmed Australia's complete legal independence from the United Kingdom, despite the shared monarch. It emphasized the evolution of the Australian Constitution and its interpretation over time to reflect Australia's developing nationhood.

### Attorney-General (WA) v Australian National Airlines Commission (1976)
**Citation:** 138 CLR 492; [1976] HCA 66

**Constitutional Sections:** Section 128 (mode of altering the Constitution)

**Summary:** This case involved interpretation of amendments made to the Constitution through section 128.

**Impact:** The High Court held that constitutional amendments should be given their full force and effect, rather than being interpreted narrowly to preserve the original text's meaning.
