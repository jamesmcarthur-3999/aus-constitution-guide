# Chapter VII - Miscellaneous

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter VII of the Australian Constitution, covering sections 125-127, addresses miscellaneous matters that didn't fit in the other chapters. This short chapter originally contained three sections, but section 127 (which excluded Aboriginal people from being counted in the Commonwealth's population) was repealed by a 1967 referendum.

## Section 125 - Seat of Government

**Original Text:**
> The seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth, and shall be in the State of New South Wales, and be distant not less than one hundred miles from Sydney.
> 
> Such territory shall contain an area of not less than one hundred square miles, and such portion thereof as shall consist of Crown lands shall be granted to the Commonwealth without any payment therefor.
> 
> The Parliament shall sit at Melbourne until it meets at the seat of Government.

**Plain English:**
The national capital (seat of Government) must:
1. Be determined by Parliament
2. Be on land granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth
3. Be owned by the Commonwealth
4. Be in New South Wales
5. Be at least 100 miles from Sydney
6. Have an area of at least 100 square miles

Any Crown land included in this territory must be granted to the Commonwealth for free.

Until Parliament meets at the seat of Government, it will sit in Melbourne.

This section set the requirements for establishing the Australian Capital Territory, which now contains Canberra, the national capital.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 126 - Power to Her Majesty to authorise Governor-General to appoint deputies

**Original Text:**
> The Queen may authorise the Governor-General to appoint any person, or any persons jointly or severally, to be his deputy or deputies within any part of the Commonwealth, and in that capacity to exercise during the pleasure of the Governor-General such powers and functions of the Governor-General as he thinks fit to assign to such deputy or deputies, subject to any limitations expressed or directions given by the Queen; but the appointment of such deputy or deputies shall not affect the exercise by the Governor-General himself of any power or function.

**Plain English:**
The Queen can authorize the Governor-General to:
1. Appoint one or more people as deputies
2. Assign those deputies to exercise certain powers and functions of the Governor-General
3. Limit those deputies' powers as the Governor-General sees fit, subject to any limitations or directions from the Queen

The Governor-General can still exercise any power or function even after appointing deputies.

This section allows for the Governor-General's powers to be delegated when necessary, such as when the Governor-General is unavailable or traveling.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## [Section 127 - Aborigines not to be counted in reckoning population]

**Original Text:**
> In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, or of a State or other part of the Commonwealth, aboriginal natives shall not be counted.

**Plain English:**
This section was repealed by referendum in 1967. It had excluded Aboriginal people from being counted in population calculations for the Commonwealth or states.

The removal of this section was an important step in recognizing Aboriginal people as equal citizens.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.
