# Chapter VII - Miscellaneous

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter VII of the Australian Constitution contains miscellaneous provisions that don't fit neatly into the other chapters. This is one of the shortest chapters, containing only two sections (125-126). There was originally a third section (Section 127) regarding the counting of Aboriginal people in population statistics, but this was removed by referendum in 1967.

### Section 125 - Seat of Government

**Original Text:**
> The seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth, and shall be in the State of New South Wales, and be distant not less than one hundred miles from Sydney.
> 
> Such territory shall contain an area of not less than one hundred square miles, and such portion thereof as shall consist of Crown lands shall be granted to the Commonwealth without any payment therefor.
> 
> The Parliament shall sit at Melbourne until it meet at the seat of Government.

**Plain English:**
The seat of Government (capital city) of the Commonwealth:
1. Will be decided by Parliament
2. Must be on land granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth
3. Must be owned by the Commonwealth
4. Must be in New South Wales
5. Must be at least 100 miles (161 kilometers) from Sydney
6. Must be on territory of at least 100 square miles (259 square kilometers) in area

If any of this territory is Crown land (government-owned land), it must be given to the Commonwealth for free.

Until Parliament meets in the capital city, it will sit in Melbourne.

This section set the parameters for establishing Canberra as the national capital. Parliament began sitting in Canberra in 1927.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 126 - Power to Her Majesty to authorise Governor-General to appoint deputies

**Original Text:**
> The Queen may authorise the Governor-General to appoint any person, or any persons jointly or severally, to be his deputy or deputies within any part of the Commonwealth, and in that capacity to exercise during the pleasure of the Governor-General such powers and functions of the Governor-General as he thinks fit to assign to such deputy or deputies, subject to any limitations expressed or directions given by the Queen; but the appointment of such deputy or deputies shall not affect the exercise by the Governor-General himself of any power or function.

**Plain English:**
The Queen can authorize the Governor-General to appoint one or more people as deputies within any part of Australia. These deputies can exercise whatever powers and functions of the Governor-General that the Governor-General assigns to them, unless the Queen places limits or gives specific directions. The Governor-General can still exercise all powers and functions even after appointing deputies.

This section allows for the appointment of deputies to act on behalf of the Governor-General when necessary, such as when the Governor-General is overseas or otherwise unavailable.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### [Section 127 - Aborigines not to be counted in reckoning population]

**Original Text (repealed):**
> In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, or of a State or other part of the Commonwealth, aboriginal natives shall not be counted.

**Plain English:**
Aboriginal people were not to be counted when calculating the population of the Commonwealth, a State, or any other part of the Commonwealth.

This discriminatory provision was removed by the 1967 referendum, which received over 90% support nationwide. The referendum amended the Constitution to include Aboriginal people in the census and to allow the Commonwealth Parliament to make special laws for Aboriginal people.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section before its removal.

## Significance of Chapter VII

While brief, Chapter VII contains provisions that have had significant practical and symbolic importance:

1. **National Capital**: Section 125 established the framework for creating Australia's purpose-built capital city, Canberra. The location was chosen as a compromise between Sydney and Melbourne, which had both sought to be the national capital.

2. **Administrative Continuity**: Section 126 ensures the continuity of executive government functions when the Governor-General is unavailable, by allowing for the appointment of deputies.

3. **Constitutional Recognition of Aboriginal People**: The removal of Section 127 in 1967 was a symbolic milestone in recognizing Aboriginal people as full citizens to be included in the national census. This amendment, along with changes to Section 51(xxvi) made in the same referendum, expanded Commonwealth power to make laws for Aboriginal people.

The removal of Section 127 marked the first successful amendment to the Australian Constitution in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It reflected changing attitudes toward Indigenous Australians and was an important step toward addressing historical injustices, though many issues remained unresolved.

The 1967 referendum demonstrated that the Constitution could be changed to remove discriminatory provisions and to better reflect evolving social values. It remains one of the most successful referendums in Australian history, receiving overwhelming support in all six states and nationally.
