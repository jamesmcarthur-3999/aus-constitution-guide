# Chapter VI - New States

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter VI of the Australian Constitution, covering sections 121-124, provides for the admission or establishment of new states and the governance of territories. This short chapter sets out the framework for potential changes to Australia's federal structure.

## Section 121 - New States may be admitted or established

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may admit to the Commonwealth or establish new States, and may upon such admission or establishment make or impose such terms and conditions, including the extent of representation in either House of the Parliament, as it thinks fit.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth Parliament can:
1. Admit new states to the Commonwealth
2. Establish new states
3. Set whatever terms and conditions it chooses for new states, including how many representatives they get in Parliament

This section gives Parliament the power to expand the federation by adding new states, either by admitting external territories or by creating new states from existing ones.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section, as no new states have been created since federation.

## Section 122 - Government of territories

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth Parliament can:
1. Make laws for territories that:
   - Are surrendered by a state and accepted by the Commonwealth
   - Are placed under Commonwealth authority by the monarch and accepted by the Commonwealth
   - Are acquired by the Commonwealth in other ways
2. Allow territories to be represented in Parliament on whatever terms Parliament decides

This section gives Parliament broad powers to govern territories and determine their representation in Parliament.

**Key Cases:**
- **Berwick Ltd v Gray (1976)**: Confirmed Parliament's broad power to make laws for territories, not constrained by other limitations in the Constitution.
- **Western Australia v Commonwealth (1975)** (Territories Representation Case): Upheld the validity of legislation providing for senators to represent territories.

## Section 123 - Alteration of limits of States

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament of the Commonwealth may, with the consent of the Parliament of a State, and the approval of the majority of the electors of the State voting upon the question, increase, diminish, or otherwise alter the limits of the State, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed on, and may, with the like consent, make provision respecting the effect and operation of any increase or diminution or alteration of territory in relation to any State affected.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth Parliament can change a state's boundaries if:
1. The state's parliament consents
2. A majority of voters in the state approve in a referendum
3. The terms and conditions are agreed upon

The Commonwealth can also, with state consent, make provisions for how boundary changes affect the states involved.

This section provides a process for altering state boundaries while respecting state autonomy through the requirements for state parliament consent and voter approval.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 124 - Formation of new States

**Original Text:**
> A new State may be formed by separation of territory from a State, but only with the consent of the Parliament thereof, and a new State may be formed by the union of two or more States or parts of States, but only with the consent of the Parliaments of the States affected.

**Plain English:**
New states can be formed in two ways:
1. By separating territory from an existing state, but only if that state's parliament agrees
2. By joining two or more states or parts of states, but only if all affected state parliaments agree

This section provides a mechanism for internal reorganization of the federation, while requiring the consent of affected states.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section, as no new states have been formed since federation.
