# Chapter VI - New States

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter VI of the Australian Constitution deals with the admission or establishment of new states and the governance of territories. This is one of the shortest chapters in the Constitution, containing only four sections (121-124).

### Section 121 - New States may be admitted or established

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may admit to the Commonwealth or establish new States, and may upon such admission or establishment make or impose such terms and conditions, including the extent of representation in either House of the Parliament, as it thinks fit.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can:
1. Admit new States to the Commonwealth (e.g., if an external territory became a State)
2. Establish new States (e.g., by creating a new State from part of an existing State)

When admitting or establishing a new State, Parliament can set whatever terms and conditions it thinks appropriate, including how many representatives the new State will have in the Senate and House of Representatives.

This section provides a mechanism to expand the federation beyond the original six States.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 122 - Government of territories

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can make laws governing any territory that:
1. Was surrendered by a State and accepted by the Commonwealth (like the Australian Capital Territory)
2. Was placed under Commonwealth authority by the Queen and accepted by the Commonwealth (like the Northern Territory)
3. Was acquired by the Commonwealth in some other way

Parliament can also allow territories to be represented in either House of Parliament to the extent and on the terms Parliament decides.

This section gives the Commonwealth broad powers over territories, unlike the more limited powers it has in relation to States.

**Key Cases:**
- **Teori Tau v Commonwealth (1969)**: The High Court held that Section 122 gives the Commonwealth much broader power to make laws for territories than it has for States.
- **Western Australia v Commonwealth (1975)** ("Territories Representation Case"): The High Court upheld legislation giving the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory representation in the Senate, finding this did not conflict with the principle of equal State representation in the Senate.

### Section 123 - Alteration of limits of States

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament of the Commonwealth may, with the consent of the Parliament of a State, and the approval of the majority of the electors of the State voting upon the question, increase, diminish, or otherwise alter the limits of the State, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed on, and may, with the like consent, make provision respecting the effect and operation of any increase or diminution or alteration of territory in relation to any State affected.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can change a State's boundaries (increase, decrease, or otherwise alter them), but only if:
1. The State Parliament agrees; and
2. A majority of the State's voters approve the change in a referendum

Any such change must be made on terms and conditions agreed between the Commonwealth and State. With the State's agreement, Parliament can also make laws about how the territorial change affects the State.

This section protects States from having their boundaries changed without their consent.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 124 - Formation of new States

**Original Text:**
> A new State may be formed by separation of territory from a State, but only with the consent of the Parliament thereof, and a new State may be formed by the union of two or more States or parts of States, but only with the consent of the Parliaments of the States affected.

**Plain English:**
A new State can be formed in two ways:
1. By separating part of an existing State, but only if that State's Parliament agrees
2. By joining two or more States, or parts of States, but only if the Parliaments of all affected States agree

This section provides mechanisms for creating new States from existing States, while requiring consent from the affected States.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Significance of Chapter VI

While short, Chapter VI addresses important aspects of Australia's federal system:

1. **Flexibility for Growth**: It provides mechanisms for the federation to evolve by adding new States, altering State boundaries, or forming new States from existing ones.

2. **Territorial Powers**: It establishes the Commonwealth's authority over territories, which has been important for governing the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory, and external territories.

3. **State Protection**: It protects States from having their boundaries altered or territory separated without their consent.

Despite these provisions, no new States have been admitted or established since Federation in 1901. The Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory have remained territories rather than becoming States, though they have been granted forms of self-government and representation in Parliament under Section 122.

Proposals for new States have occasionally emerged, such as:
- Separating North Queensland as a new State
- Making the Northern Territory a State
- Creating a new State in New England (northern New South Wales)

However, none of these proposals has succeeded. A 1967 referendum on creating a new State in New England was defeated.

The provisions of this chapter reflect the framers' foresight in creating a Constitution that could accommodate changes to Australia's political geography while respecting the rights of existing States.
