# Chapter IV - Finance and Trade

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter IV of the Australian Constitution deals with financial matters and trade. This chapter, covering sections 81-105, establishes the framework for federal financial powers, including taxation, revenue, and spending. It also addresses trade and commerce between states and the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states in financial matters.

## Section 81 - Consolidated Revenue Fund

**Original Text:**
> All revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution.

**Plain English:**
All money collected by the Commonwealth government, from taxes or other sources, goes into a single fund called the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Money can only be spent from this fund:
1. For the purposes of the Commonwealth
2. In the manner specified by the Constitution
3. Subject to any charges or liabilities imposed by the Constitution

This section establishes that all Commonwealth revenue must go into a central fund, ensuring accountability and oversight of government spending.

**Key Cases:**
- **Pape v Commissioner of Taxation (2009)**: Clarified that section 81 does not provide standalone power to spend money; appropriations must be supported by specific constitutional powers.

## Section 82 - Expenditure charged thereon

**Original Text:**
> The costs, charges, and expenses incident to the collection, management, and receipt of the Consolidated Revenue Fund shall form the first charge thereon; and the revenue of the Commonwealth shall in the first instance be applied to the payment of the expenditure of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The costs of collecting, managing, and receiving money into the Consolidated Revenue Fund are the first expenses to be paid from the fund. Money in the fund must first be used to cover the Commonwealth's expenses.

This section establishes priorities for government spending, ensuring that the cost of collecting revenue and essential Commonwealth expenditure take precedence.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 83 - Money to be appropriated by law

**Original Text:**
> No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth government cannot spend money unless Parliament has passed a law authorizing that spending (an appropriation).

This is a fundamental principle of parliamentary control over government spending, ensuring the executive cannot spend public money without parliamentary approval.

**Key Cases:**
- **Northern Suburbs General Cemetery Reserve Trust v Commonwealth (1993)**: Confirmed the importance of parliamentary appropriation for government spending.

## Section 84 - Transfer of officers

**Original Text:**
> When any department of the public service of a State is transferred to the Commonwealth:
> 
> (i) all officers of the department shall become subject to the control of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth;
> 
> (ii) all property of the State of any kind, used exclusively in connection with the department, shall become vested in the Commonwealth; but, in the case of the departments controlling customs and excise and bounties, for such time only as the Governor-General in Council may declare to be necessary;
> 
> (iii) the Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State, of any kind used, but not exclusively used in connection with the department; the value thereof shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in, as nearly as may be, the manner in which the value of land, or of an interest in land, taken by the Commonwealth for public purposes is ascertained under the law of the Commonwealth in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth;
> 
> (iv) the Commonwealth shall compensate the State for the value of any property passing to the Commonwealth under this section; if no agreement can be made as to the mode of compensation, it shall be determined under laws to be made by the Parliament;
> 
> (v) the Commonwealth shall, at the date of the transfer, assume the current obligations of the State in respect of the department transferred.

**Plain English:**
When a state government department is transferred to the Commonwealth:
1. All staff of the department come under Commonwealth control
2. All property exclusively used by the department becomes Commonwealth property (but for customs, excise, and bounties departments, only for as long as necessary)
3. The Commonwealth may acquire any property partially used by the department
4. The Commonwealth must compensate the state for the value of any property transferred
5. The Commonwealth takes on the current obligations of the state related to the transferred department

This section addressed the practical transition of functions from state governments to the Commonwealth.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 85 - Transfer of property of State

**Original Text:**
> When any department of the public service of a State is transferred to the Commonwealth:
> 
> (i) all property of the State of any kind, used exclusively in connection with the department, shall become vested in the Commonwealth; but, in the case of the departments controlling customs and excise and bounties, for such time only as the Governor-General in Council may declare to be necessary;
> 
> (ii) the Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State, of any kind used, but not exclusively used in connection with the department; the value thereof shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in, as nearly as may be, the manner in which the value of land, or of an interest in land, taken by the Commonwealth for public purposes is ascertained under the law of the State in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth;
> 
> (iii) the Commonwealth shall compensate the State for the value of any property passing to the Commonwealth under this section; if no agreement can be made as to the mode of compensation, it shall be determined under laws to be made by the Parliament;
> 
> (iv) the Commonwealth shall, at the date of the transfer, assume the current obligations of the State in respect of the department transferred.

**Plain English:**
This section largely repeats the property transfer provisions from section 84, specifying:
1. Property exclusively used by a transferred department becomes Commonwealth property
2. The Commonwealth may acquire property partially used by the department
3. The Commonwealth must compensate the state for transferred property
4. The Commonwealth takes on the current obligations of the transferred department

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 86 - [Collection of existing duties of customs and of excise]

**Original Text:**
> On the establishment of the Commonwealth, the collection and control of duties of customs and of excise, and the control of the payment of bounties, shall pass to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
When the Commonwealth was established, the federal government took over:
1. Collecting and controlling customs duties (taxes on imported goods)
2. Collecting and controlling excise duties (taxes on certain goods produced within Australia)
3. Controlling the payment of bounties (government subsidies)

This section transferred important revenue-raising powers from the states to the Commonwealth.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 87 - [Bookkeeping period of 10 years]

**Original Text:**
> During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of customs and of excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure.
> 
> The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
For the first ten years after federation, and until Parliament decided otherwise:
1. The Commonwealth could only use up to one-quarter of the net revenue from customs and excise duties for its own expenditure
2. The remaining three-quarters had to be paid to the states or used to pay interest on state debts taken over by the Commonwealth

This section ensured that states would continue to receive most of the customs and excise revenue during the transition to the new federal system.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 88 - Uniform duties of customs

**Original Text:**
> Uniform duties of customs shall be imposed within two years after the establishment of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
Within two years of the establishment of the Commonwealth, the same customs duties must apply throughout Australia. This means the Commonwealth had to create a single national system of customs duties to replace the different systems that had existed in each colony.

This section aimed to create a single national market by eliminating different customs regimes between states.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 89 - Payment to States before uniform duties

**Original Text:**
> Until the imposition of uniform duties of customs:
> 
> (i) the Commonwealth shall credit to each State the revenues collected therein by the Commonwealth;
> 
> (ii) the Commonwealth shall debit to each State:
> 
> (a) the expenditure therein of the Commonwealth incurred solely for the maintenance or continuance, as at the time of transfer, of any department transferred from the State to the Commonwealth;
> 
> (b) the proportion of the State, according to the number of its people, in the other expenditure of the Commonwealth;
> 
> (iii) the Commonwealth shall pay to each State month by month the balance (if any) in favour of the State.

**Plain English:**
Until uniform customs duties were imposed:
1. The Commonwealth credited each state with the revenue collected in that state
2. The Commonwealth debited each state for:
   - Commonwealth expenses in that state for maintaining transferred departments
   - The state's share (based on population) of other Commonwealth expenditure
3. The Commonwealth paid each state monthly any balance in the state's favor

This section established interim financial arrangements until the national customs system was in place.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 90 - Exclusive power over customs, excise, and bounties

**Original Text:**
> On the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive.
> 
> On the imposition of uniform duties of customs, all laws of the several States imposing duties of customs or of excise, or offering bounties on the production or export of goods, shall cease to have effect, but any grant of or agreement for any such bounty lawfully made by or under the authority of the Government of any State shall be taken to be good if made before the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, and not otherwise.

**Plain English:**
Once uniform customs duties were imposed:
1. Only the Commonwealth Parliament could impose customs and excise duties or grant production or export bounties
2. All state laws imposing customs or excise duties, or offering production or export bounties, became invalid
3. State bounties or agreements for bounties made before June 30, 1898, remained valid

This section gave the Commonwealth exclusive power over key revenue sources, preventing states from imposing their own customs or excise duties.

**Key Cases:**
- **Ha v New South Wales (1997)**: Held that states cannot impose excise duties, which include taxes on the production, manufacture, sale or distribution of goods. This has significantly limited states' revenue-raising options.

## Section 91 - Exceptions as to bounties

**Original Text:**
> Nothing in this Constitution prohibits a State from granting any aid to or bounty on mining for gold, silver, or other metals, nor from granting, with the consent of both Houses of the Parliament of the Commonwealth expressed by resolution, any aid to or bounty on the production or export of goods.

**Plain English:**
Despite section 90, states can:
1. Grant aid or bounties for mining gold, silver, or other metals
2. Grant aid or bounties for the production or export of goods if both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament agree by resolution

This section provided exceptions to the Commonwealth's exclusive power over bounties.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 92 - Trade within the Commonwealth to be free

**Original Text:**
> On the imposition of uniform duties of customs, trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States, whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free.
> 
> But notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, goods imported before the imposition of uniform duties of customs into any State, or into any Colony which, whilst the goods remain therein, becomes a State, shall, on thence passing into another State within two years after the imposition of such duties, be liable to any duty chargeable on the importation of such goods into the Commonwealth, less any duty paid in respect of the goods on their importation.

**Plain English:**
After uniform customs duties were imposed:
1. Trade, commerce, and movement between states must be "absolutely free"
2. For goods imported into a state/colony before uniform duties were imposed, if those goods are then moved to another state within two years, they are subject to Commonwealth import duties less any duty already paid

This section aimed to create a single national market by removing barriers to interstate trade.

**Key Cases:**
- **Cole v Whitfield (1988)**: Overturned decades of earlier interpretations and held that section 92 prohibits laws that discriminate against interstate trade and commerce and protect intrastate trade and commerce. This case significantly reshaped understanding of this section.

## Section 93 - Payment to States for five years after uniform tariffs

**Original Text:**
> During the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides:
> 
> (i) the duties of customs chargeable on goods imported into a State and afterwards passing into another State for consumption, and the duties of excise paid on goods produced or manufactured in a State and afterwards passing into another State for consumption, shall be taken to have been collected not in the former but in the latter State;
> 
> (ii) subject to the last subsection, the Commonwealth shall credit revenue, debit expenditure, and pay balances to the several States as prescribed for the period preceding the imposition of uniform duties of customs.

**Plain English:**
For the first five years after uniform customs duties were imposed, and until Parliament decided otherwise:
1. Customs duties on goods imported into one state but consumed in another state, and excise duties on goods produced in one state but consumed in another, were treated as collected in the state of consumption
2. The Commonwealth continued the system of crediting revenue, debiting expenditure, and paying balances to states as it did before uniform duties

This section ensured a fair distribution of customs and excise revenues among states during the transition period.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 94 - Distribution of surplus

**Original Text:**
> After five years from the imposition of uniform duties of customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
After five years from the imposition of uniform customs duties, Parliament could decide how to distribute any surplus Commonwealth revenue among the states on a monthly basis, on whatever basis it considered fair.

This section gave Parliament flexibility in financial arrangements with the states after the initial transition period.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 95 - Customs duties of Western Australia

**Original Text:**
> Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the Parliament of the State of Western Australia, if that State be an Original State, may, during the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, impose duties of customs on goods passing into that State and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth; and such duties shall be collected by the Commonwealth.
> 
> But any duty so imposed on any goods shall not exceed during the first of such years the duty chargeable on the goods under the law of Western Australia in force at the imposition of uniform duties, and shall not exceed during the second, third, fourth, and fifth of such years respectively, four-fifths, three-fifths, two-fifths, and one-fifth of such latter duty, and all duties imposed under this section shall cease at the expiration of the fifth year after the imposition of uniform duties.
> 
> If at any time during the five years the duty on any goods under this section is higher than the duty imposed by the Commonwealth on the importation of the like goods, then such higher duty shall be collected on the goods when imported into Western Australia from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
Despite other provisions in the Constitution, Western Australia (if it joined as an original state) could:
1. Impose customs duties on goods entering the state from other parts of Australia for the first five years after uniform customs duties were imposed
2. The duties would be collected by the Commonwealth
3. The duties had to decrease each year: 100% of the pre-federation rate in the first year, 80% in the second year, 60% in the third year, 40% in the fourth year, and 20% in the fifth year
4. If Western Australia's duty on goods from other states was higher than the Commonwealth duty on imported goods, the higher duty would apply to goods imported into Western Australia

This special provision recognized Western Australia's unique situation as a geographically isolated state whose economy relied heavily on customs duties.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 96 - Financial assistance to States

**Original Text:**
> During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit.

**Plain English:**
For the first ten years after federation, and until Parliament decided otherwise, the Commonwealth Parliament could provide financial assistance to any state on whatever terms and conditions it chose.

This section has become one of the most important in the Constitution, allowing the Commonwealth to influence state policies by attaching conditions to grants of money.

**Key Cases:**
- **Victoria v Commonwealth (Second Uniform Tax Case) (1957)**: Upheld the Commonwealth's power to make grants to states conditional on the states not imposing income tax, thereby confirming the broad scope of the section 96 power.

## Section 97 - Audit

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the laws in force in any State with respect to the receipt of revenue and the expenditure of money on account of the Government of the State, and the review and audit of such receipt and expenditure, shall apply to the receipt of revenue and the expenditure of money on account of the Commonwealth in the State in the same manner as if the Commonwealth, or the Government or an officer of the Commonwealth, were mentioned whenever the State, or the Government or an officer of the State, is mentioned.

**Plain English:**
Until Parliament legislated otherwise, each state's laws about receiving and spending government money, and reviewing and auditing those finances, would apply to Commonwealth finances in that state as if references to the state government referred to the Commonwealth government.

This section provided for the audit of Commonwealth finances during the transition period after federation.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 98 - Trade and commerce includes navigation and State railways

**Original Text:**
> The power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of any State.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth Parliament's power to make laws about trade and commerce includes the power to make laws about:
1. Navigation and shipping
2. Railways owned by states

This section clarified the scope of the trade and commerce power in section 51(i) to include key transportation systems.

**Key Cases:**
- **Australian Steamships Ltd v Malcolm (1914)**: Confirmed the Commonwealth's power to regulate shipping under section 98.

## Section 99 - Commonwealth not to give preference

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth cannot make laws or regulations about trade, commerce, or revenue that favor one state (or part of a state) over another state (or part of a state).

This section aims to prevent the Commonwealth from discriminating between states in its regulation of trade, commerce, and revenue.

**Key Cases:**
- **Crowe v Commonwealth (1935)**: Clarified that section 99 applies to preferences in laws or regulations, not to executive administration or application of laws.

## Section 100 - Nor abridge right to use water

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth cannot make laws or regulations about trade or commerce that restrict the right of a state or its residents to reasonably use river water for conservation or irrigation.

This section recognizes the importance of water access for states, particularly those that rely on rivers for agriculture.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section directly, although water management has been a significant issue in Commonwealth-state relations.

## Section 101 - Inter-State Commission

**Original Text:**
> There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder.

**Plain English:**
There shall be an Inter-State Commission with powers (as determined by Parliament) to make decisions and administer:
1. The trade and commerce provisions of the Constitution
2. Laws made under those provisions

Although this section requires the establishment of an Inter-State Commission, it has not operated continuously in Australia's history.

**Key Cases:**
- **New South Wales v Commonwealth (Wheat Case) (1915)**: Limited the judicial powers of the Inter-State Commission.

## Section 102 - Parliament may forbid preferences by State

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid, as to railways, any preference or discrimination by any State, or by any authority constituted under a State, if such preference or discrimination is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State; due regard being had to the financial responsibilities incurred by any State in connexion with the construction and maintenance of its railways. But no preference or discrimination shall, within the meaning of this section, be taken to be undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State, unless so adjudged by the Inter-State Commission.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can make laws about trade or commerce to prohibit a state or state authority from giving unfair preferences or discriminating on railways if such actions are unreasonable or unjust to any state. However, the financial responsibilities of states for building and maintaining railways must be considered.

A preference or discrimination can only be considered unreasonable or unjust if the Inter-State Commission judges it to be so.

This section addresses potential unfair practices in state railway operations.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 103 - Commissioners' appointment, tenure, and remuneration

**Original Text:**
> The members of the Inter-State Commission:
> 
> (i) shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council;
> 
> (ii) shall hold office for seven years, but may be removed within that time by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session praying for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity;
> 
> (iii) shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; but such remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.

**Plain English:**
Members of the Inter-State Commission:
1. Are appointed by the Governor-General in Council
2. Serve for seven years, but can be removed for proven misbehavior or incapacity if both houses of Parliament agree and the Governor-General in Council acts on their request
3. Receive remuneration determined by Parliament, which cannot be reduced during their term of office

This section establishes protections for the independence of Inter-State Commission members, similar to those for judges.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 104 - Saving of certain rates

**Original Text:**
> Nothing in this Constitution shall render unlawful any rate for the carriage of goods upon a railway, the property of a State, if the rate is deemed by the Inter-State Commission to be necessary for the development of the territory of the State, and if the rate applies equally to goods within the State and to goods passing into the State from other States.

**Plain English:**
The Constitution does not prohibit a railway shipping rate on a state-owned railway if:
1. The Inter-State Commission considers the rate necessary for the state's development
2. The rate applies equally to goods within the state and goods coming into the state from other states

This section provides an exception to the prohibition on preferences and discriminations in section 102.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 105 - Taking over public debts of States

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may take over from the States their public debts, or a proportion thereof according to the respective numbers of their people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, and may convert, renew, or consolidate such debts, or any part thereof; and the States shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over, and thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debts shall be deducted and retained from the portions of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth payable to the several States, or if such surplus is insufficient, or if there is no surplus, then the deficiency or the whole amount shall be paid by the several States.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can take over state public debts (or a portion based on state populations) and can convert, renew, or consolidate these debts. The states must indemnify the Commonwealth for the debts taken over. Interest on the debts will be deducted from surplus revenue payable to the states, or if there's no surplus, the states must pay the Commonwealth.

This section allows the Commonwealth to manage state debts, potentially achieving better interest rates and financial management.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 105A - Agreements with respect to State debts

**Original Text:**
> (1) The Commonwealth may make agreements with the States with respect to the public debts of the States, including:
> 
> (a) the taking over of such debts by the Commonwealth;
> 
> (b) the management of such debts;
> 
> (c) the payment of interest and the provision and management of sinking funds in respect of such debts;
> 
> (d) the consolidation, renewal, conversion, and redemption of such debts;
> 
> (e) the indemnification of the Commonwealth by the States in respect of debts taken over by the Commonwealth; and
> 
> (f) the borrowing of money by the States or by the Commonwealth, or by the Commonwealth for the States.
> 
> (2) The Parliament may make laws for validating any such agreement made before the commencement of this section.
> 
> (3) The Parliament may make laws for the carrying out by the parties thereto of any such agreement.
> 
> (4) Any such agreement may be varied or rescinded by the parties thereto.
> 
> (5) Every such agreement and any such variation thereof shall be binding upon the Commonwealth and the States parties thereto notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution or the Constitution of the several States or in any law of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or of any State.
> 
> (6) The powers conferred by this section shall not be construed as being limited in any way by the provisions of section one hundred and five of this Constitution.

**Plain English:**
This section, added in 1929, allows the Commonwealth to:
1. Make agreements with states about their public debts
2. These agreements can cover taking over debts, managing debts, paying interest, consolidating or converting debts, indemnification by states, and borrowing money
3. Parliament can validate agreements made before this section was added
4. Parliament can make laws to implement these agreements
5. The agreements can be changed or cancelled by mutual agreement
6. These agreements override any contradictory provisions in the Constitution or laws
7. These powers are not limited by section 105

This section provided greater flexibility for Commonwealth-state financial arrangements than section 105.

**Key Cases:**
- **New South Wales v Commonwealth (Garnishee Case) (1932)**: Upheld the validity of the Financial Agreement and confirmed that section 105A agreements can override other constitutional provisions.
