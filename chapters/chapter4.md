# Chapter IV - Finance and Trade

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter IV of the Australian Constitution deals with economic and financial matters, including government revenue, expenditure, trade, and the relationship between the Commonwealth and states in these areas. This chapter covers sections 81-105 and has been the subject of many important High Court cases.

### Section 81 - Consolidated Revenue Fund

**Original Text:**
> All revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution.

**Plain English:**
All money received by the Commonwealth government goes into a single fund called the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This money can only be spent for purposes of the Commonwealth, in accordance with the rules set out in the Constitution.

**Key Cases:**
- **Pape v Commissioner of Taxation (2009)**: The High Court held that section 81 does not grant a standalone spending power to the Commonwealth. Money can only be appropriated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for purposes within the Commonwealth's constitutional powers.

### Section 82 - Expenditure charged thereon

**Original Text:**
> The costs, charges, and expenses incident to the collection, management, and receipt of the Consolidated Revenue Fund shall form the first charge thereon; and the revenue of the Commonwealth shall in the first instance be applied to the payment of the expenditure of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The costs of collecting and managing the Commonwealth's revenue are the first expenses to be paid from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Commonwealth's revenue must first be used to pay for the Commonwealth's expenditure.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 83 - Money to be appropriated by law

**Original Text:**
> No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law.
> 
> But until the expiration of one month after the first meeting of the Parliament the Governor-General in Council may draw from the Treasury and expend such moneys as may be necessary for the maintenance of any department transferred to the Commonwealth and for the holding of the first elections for the Parliament.

**Plain English:**
Money can only be spent from the Commonwealth Treasury if Parliament has passed a law allowing the expenditure. However, during the first month after the first meeting of Parliament, the Governor-General (acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council) could spend money necessary to run the departments transferred to the Commonwealth and to hold the first elections.

**Key Cases:**
- **Williams v Commonwealth (2012)** ("School Chaplains Case"): The High Court confirmed that, with limited exceptions, Commonwealth spending requires both an appropriation under section 83 and a supporting head of legislative power.

### Section 84 - Transfer of officers

**Original Text:**
> When any department of the public service of a State is transferred to the Commonwealth—
> 
> (i) all officers of the department shall become subject to the control of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth;
> 
> (ii) all property of the State of any kind, used exclusively in connexion with the department, shall become vested in the Commonwealth; but, in the case of the departments controlling customs and excise and bounties, for such time only as the Governor-General in Council may declare to be necessary;
> 
> (iii) the Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State, of any kind used, but not exclusively used in connexion with the department; the value thereof shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in, as nearly as may be, the manner in which the value of land, or of an interest in land, taken by the State for public purposes is ascertained under the law of the State in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth;
> 
> (iv) the Commonwealth shall compensate the State for the value of any property passing to the Commonwealth under this section; if no agreement can be made as to the mode of compensation, it shall be determined under laws to be made by the Parliament;
> 
> (v) the Commonwealth shall, at the date of the transfer, assume the current obligations of the State in respect of the department transferred.

**Plain English:**
When a state department is transferred to the Commonwealth:
- All employees of that department come under Commonwealth control
- All property exclusively used by that department becomes Commonwealth property (for customs, excise, and bounties departments, this is only for as long as necessary)
- The Commonwealth may acquire property that was partly used by the department
- The Commonwealth must compensate the state for the value of any property transferred
- The Commonwealth takes over the department's current obligations

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 85 - Transfer of property of State

**Original Text:**
> When any department of the public service of a State is transferred to the Commonwealth—
> 
> (i) all property of the State of any kind, used exclusively in connexion with the department, shall become vested in the Commonwealth; but, in the case of the departments controlling customs and excise and bounties, for such time only as the Governor-General in Council may declare to be necessary;
> 
> (ii) the Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State, of any kind used, but not exclusively used in connexion with the department; the value thereof shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in, as nearly as may be, the manner in which the value of land, or of an interest in land, taken by the State for public purposes is ascertained under the law of the State in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth;
> 
> (iii) the Commonwealth shall compensate the State for the value of any property passing to the Commonwealth under this section; if no agreement can be made as to the mode of compensation, it shall be determined under laws to be made by the Parliament;
> 
> (iv) the Commonwealth shall, at the date of the transfer, assume the current obligations of the State in respect of the department transferred.

**Plain English:**
This section repeats parts of section 84, specifically about the transfer of property when a state department is transferred to the Commonwealth. It ensures that:
- Property exclusively used by the department becomes Commonwealth property
- The Commonwealth may acquire property partly used by the department
- The Commonwealth must compensate the state for any property transferred
- The Commonwealth takes over the department's obligations

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 86 - [Collection and control of duties of customs and of excise, and the control of the payment of bounties]

**Original Text:**
> On the establishment of the Commonwealth, the collection and control of duties of customs and of excise, and the control of the payment of bounties, shall pass to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
When the Commonwealth was established, the power to collect and control customs duties (taxes on imported goods), excise duties (taxes on domestically produced goods), and to control the payment of bounties (government subsidies) passed to the Commonwealth government.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 87 - [Duration for which provision was made]

**Original Text:**
> During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of customs and of excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure.
> 
> The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
For the first ten years after federation, and until Parliament decided otherwise, the Commonwealth could only use up to one-quarter of its net revenue from customs and excise duties for its own expenses. The rest had to be paid to the states or used to pay interest on state debts taken over by the Commonwealth.

**Note:** This section is now spent (no longer in effect) as the ten-year period has long passed, and Parliament has since made other arrangements.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 88 - Uniform duties of customs

**Original Text:**
> Uniform duties of customs shall be imposed within two years after the establishment of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
Within two years of the Commonwealth being established, the same customs duties (import taxes) had to apply throughout Australia.

**Note:** This section is now spent (no longer in effect) as the two-year period has long passed, and uniform customs duties were imposed in 1901.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 89 - Payment to States before uniform duties

**Original Text:**
> Until the imposition of uniform duties of customs—
> 
> (i) the Commonwealth shall credit to each State the revenues collected therein by the Commonwealth;
> 
> (ii) the Commonwealth shall debit to each State—
> 
> (a) the expenditure therein of the Commonwealth incurred solely for the maintenance or continuance, as at the time of transfer, of any department transferred from the State to the Commonwealth;
> 
> (b) the proportion of the State, according to the number of its people, in the other expenditure of the Commonwealth;
> 
> (iii) the Commonwealth shall pay to each State month by month the balance (if any) in favour of the State.

**Plain English:**
Before uniform customs duties were imposed:
- The Commonwealth would credit each state with the revenue collected in that state
- The Commonwealth would debit each state for:
  - Commonwealth expenses in that state for maintaining transferred departments
  - That state's share (based on population) of other Commonwealth expenses
- The Commonwealth would pay each state monthly any balance in the state's favor

**Note:** This section is now spent (no longer in effect) as uniform customs duties were imposed in 1901.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 90 - Exclusive power over customs, excise, and bounties

**Original Text:**
> On the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive.
> 
> On the imposition of uniform duties of customs, all laws of the several States imposing duties of customs or of excise, or offering bounties on the production or export of goods, shall cease to have effect, but any grant of or agreement for any such bounty lawfully made by or under the authority of the Government of any State shall be taken to be good if made before the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, and not otherwise.

**Plain English:**
Once uniform customs duties were imposed:
- Only the Commonwealth Parliament could impose customs duties, excise duties, or grant bounties on the production or export of goods
- State laws imposing customs or excise duties, or offering bounties, would no longer have effect
- However, state bounties or agreements for bounties made before June 30, 1898, would remain valid

**Key Cases:**
- **Ha v New South Wales (1997)**: The High Court held that "excise" in section 90 covers all taxes on the production, manufacture, sale or distribution of goods, not just taxes at the point of manufacture. This invalidated various state business franchise fees.
- **Capital Duplicators Pty Ltd v Australian Capital Territory (1992)**: The High Court confirmed that the Commonwealth's exclusive power over excise extends to territories as well as states.

### Section 91 - Exceptions as to bounties

**Original Text:**
> Nothing in this Constitution prohibits a State from granting any aid to or bounty on mining for gold, silver, or other metals, nor from granting, with the consent of both Houses of the Parliament of the Commonwealth expressed by resolution, any aid to or bounty on the production or export of goods.

**Plain English:**
Despite section 90, states can still:
- Grant financial aid or bounties for mining gold, silver, or other metals
- Grant financial aid or bounties on the production or export of other goods, but only with the approval of both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament expressed by resolution

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 92 - Trade within the Commonwealth to be free

**Original Text:**
> On the imposition of uniform duties of customs, trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States, whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free.
> 
> But notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, goods imported before the imposition of uniform duties of customs into any State, or into any Colony which, whilst the goods remain therein, becomes a State, shall, on thence passing into another State within two years after the imposition of such duties, be liable to any duty chargeable on the importation of such goods into the Commonwealth, less any duty paid in respect of the goods on their importation.

**Plain English:**
Once uniform customs duties were imposed, trade, commerce, and movement between the states must be "absolutely free," whether by land or sea transport.

However, goods imported into any state (or colony that becomes a state) before uniform customs duties were imposed, which then pass into another state within two years after the duties were imposed, are subject to any duty that would normally apply on importing those goods into the Commonwealth, minus any duty already paid when they were first imported.

**Key Cases:**
- **Cole v Whitfield (1988)**: The High Court reinterpreted section 92, finding that "absolutely free" doesn't mean free from all regulation, but rather free from discriminatory burdens of a protectionist kind. This overturned nearly 90 years of previous interpretations.
- **Betfair Pty Ltd v Western Australia (2008)**: The High Court applied the Cole v Whitfield test to invalidate Western Australian laws that prohibited the use of betting exchanges, finding they discriminated against interstate trade in a protectionist manner.

### Section 93 - Payment to States for five years after uniform Tariffs

**Original Text:**
> During the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides—
> 
> (i) the duties of customs chargeable on goods imported into a State and afterwards passing into another State for consumption, and the duties of excise paid on goods produced or manufactured in a State and afterwards passing into another State for consumption, shall be taken to have been collected not in the former but in the latter State;
> 
> (ii) subject to the last subsection, the Commonwealth shall credit revenue, debit expenditure, and pay balances to the several States as prescribed for the period preceding the imposition of uniform duties of customs.

**Plain English:**
For the first five years after uniform customs duties were imposed, and until Parliament decided otherwise:
- Customs duties on goods imported into one state and then moved to another state for consumption would be treated as if they were collected in the second state
- Excise duties on goods produced in one state and then moved to another state for consumption would be treated as if they were collected in the second state
- Apart from this change, the same system of crediting revenue, debiting expenditure, and paying balances to states would continue as before uniform duties

**Note:** This section is now spent (no longer in effect) as the five-year period has long passed, and Parliament has since made other arrangements.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 94 - Distribution of surplus

**Original Text:**
> After five years from the imposition of uniform duties of customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
After five years from the imposition of uniform customs duties, Parliament could decide how to distribute any surplus Commonwealth revenue to the states on a monthly basis, on whatever basis it considered fair.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 95 - Customs duties of Western Australia

**Original Text:**
> Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the Parliament of the State of Western Australia, if that State be an Original State, may, during the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, impose duties of customs on goods passing into that State and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth; and such duties shall be collected by the Commonwealth.
> 
> But any duty so imposed on any goods shall not exceed during the first of such years the duty chargeable on the goods under the law of Western Australia in force at the imposition of uniform duties, and shall not exceed during the second, third, fourth, and fifth of such years respectively, four-fifths, three-fifths, two-fifths, and one-fifth of such latter duty, and all duties imposed under this section shall cease at the expiration of the fifth year after the imposition of uniform duties.
> 
> If at any time during the five years the duty on any goods under this section is higher than the duty imposed by the Commonwealth on the importation of the like goods, then such higher duty shall be collected on the goods when imported into Western Australia from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
For the first five years after uniform customs duties were imposed, Western Australia (if it joined as an original state) could impose customs duties on goods coming into Western Australia from other parts of Australia. These duties would be collected by the Commonwealth.

However, these duties were subject to limits:
- In the first year, they couldn't exceed the duty that applied under Western Australian law when uniform duties were imposed
- In the second year, they couldn't exceed 4/5 of that amount
- In the third year, they couldn't exceed 3/5 of that amount
- In the fourth year, they couldn't exceed 2/5 of that amount
- In the fifth year, they couldn't exceed 1/5 of that amount

After five years, these duties would end. If at any time the Western Australian duty on goods was higher than the Commonwealth duty on similar imported goods, the higher duty would be collected on goods imported into Western Australia from outside Australia.

**Note:** This section is now spent (no longer in effect) as the five-year period has long passed.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 96 - Financial assistance to States

**Original Text:**
> During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit.

**Plain English:**
For the first ten years after federation, and until Parliament decides otherwise, the Commonwealth Parliament can provide financial assistance to any state on whatever terms and conditions it chooses.

**Key Cases:**
- **Victoria v Commonwealth (1957)** ("Second Uniform Tax Case"): The High Court upheld the validity of the Commonwealth's use of section 96 to make conditional grants to states, even if the conditions effectively direct state policy in areas of traditional state responsibility.
- **South Australia v Commonwealth (2023)** ("Sports Rorts Case"): The High Court confirmed that section 96 grants must still be authorized by legislation and upheld Parliament's ability to delegate the determination of which states receive grants to the executive government.

### Section 97 - Audit

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the laws in force in any Colony which has become or becomes a State with respect to the receipt of revenue and the expenditure of money on account of the Government of the Colony, and the review and audit of such receipt and expenditure, shall apply to the receipt of revenue and the expenditure of money on account of the Commonwealth in the State in the same manner as if the Commonwealth, or the Government or an officer of the Commonwealth, were mentioned whenever the Colony, or the Government or an officer of the Colony, is mentioned.

**Plain English:**
Until Parliament made its own laws about these matters, the financial laws of each colony (regarding receiving and spending government money, and auditing these activities) would apply to Commonwealth finances in that state, as if references to the colony or its government were references to the Commonwealth or its government.

**Note:** Parliament has since provided otherwise through legislation such as the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 98 - Trade and commerce includes navigation and State railways

**Original Text:**
> The power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of any State.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth Parliament's power to make laws about trade and commerce includes the power to make laws about:
- Navigation and shipping
- Railways owned by states

**Key Cases:**
- **Australian Coastal Shipping Commission v O'Reilly (1962)**: The High Court considered the scope of Commonwealth power over navigation and shipping.

### Section 99 - Commonwealth not to give preference

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth cannot make laws or regulations about trade, commerce, or revenue that favor one state (or part of a state) over another state (or part of a state).

**Key Cases:**
- **Crowe v Commonwealth (1935)**: The High Court held that this section only prohibits discrimination between states as such, not laws that may incidentally affect states differently.

### Section 100 - Nor abridge right to use water

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth cannot make laws or regulations about trade or commerce that restrict the right of a state or its residents to make reasonable use of river water for conservation or irrigation.

**Key Cases:**
- **Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983)** ("Tasmanian Dam Case"): Some justices considered this section in the context of the Commonwealth's power to prevent the construction of a dam in Tasmania, though it wasn't central to the decision.

### Section 101 - Inter-State Commission

**Original Text:**
> There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder.

**Plain English:**
An Inter-State Commission shall be established with powers, as determined by Parliament, to adjudicate and administer the Constitution's provisions on trade and commerce, and all laws made under those provisions.

**Note:** Although an Inter-State Commission was established in 1912, it was short-lived after the High Court limited its judicial powers in 1915. Later attempts to revive it have been unsuccessful, and no such commission currently exists.

**Key Cases:**
- **New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915)** ("Wheat Case"): The High Court held that the Inter-State Commission could not exercise judicial power under Chapter III of the Constitution, limiting its effectiveness.

### Section 102 - Parliament may forbid preferences by State

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid, as to railways, any preference or discrimination by any State, or by any authority constituted under a State, if such preference or discrimination is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State; due regard being had to the financial responsibilities incurred by any State in connexion with the construction and maintenance of its railways. But no preference or discrimination shall, within the meaning of this section, be taken to be undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State, unless so adjudged by the Inter-State Commission.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can make laws about trade or commerce that prohibit states or state authorities from giving unfair preferences or engaging in discrimination in relation to railways, if such preference or discrimination is:
- Undue and unreasonable, or
- Unjust to any state

When considering this, the financial responsibilities of states for constructing and maintaining railways must be taken into account. However, a preference or discrimination can only be considered unfair or unjust if the Inter-State Commission judges it to be so.

**Note:** Given that no Inter-State Commission currently exists, this section has limited practical effect.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 103 - Commissioners' appointment, tenure, and remuneration

**Original Text:**
> The members of the Inter-State Commission—
> 
> (i) shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council;
> 
> (ii) shall hold office for seven years, but may be removed within that time by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session praying for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity;
> 
> (iii) shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; but such remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.

**Plain English:**
Members of the Inter-State Commission:
- Are appointed by the Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council
- Serve for seven years, but can be removed earlier if both houses of Parliament agree there has been proven misbehavior or incapacity, and the Governor-General (acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council) removes them
- Receive a salary set by Parliament, which cannot be reduced during their term of office

**Note:** Given that no Inter-State Commission currently exists, this section has limited practical effect.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 104 - Saving of certain rates

**Original Text:**
> Nothing in this Constitution shall render unlawful any rate for the carriage of goods upon a railway, the property of a State, if the rate is deemed by the Inter-State Commission to be necessary for the development of the territory of the State, and if the rate applies equally to goods within the State and to goods passing into the State from other States.

**Plain English:**
The Constitution does not prohibit a state-owned railway from charging a particular freight rate if:
- The Inter-State Commission considers the rate necessary for the development of the state's territory, and
- The rate applies equally to goods within the state and to goods coming into the state from other states

**Note:** Given that no Inter-State Commission currently exists, this section has limited practical effect.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 105 - Taking over public debts of States

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may take over from the States their public debts, or a proportion thereof according to the respective numbers of their people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, and may convert, renew, or consolidate such debts, or any part thereof; and the States shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over, and thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debts shall be deducted and retained from the portions of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth payable to the several States, or if such surplus is insufficient, or if there is no surplus, then the deficiency or the whole amount shall be paid by the several States.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can take over state public debts (or a proportion of them based on population). The Commonwealth can convert, renew, or consolidate these debts. The states must compensate the Commonwealth for the debts taken over, and the interest payable on these debts will be deducted from surplus revenue that would otherwise be paid to the states. If there is insufficient or no surplus, the states must pay the interest themselves.

**Note:** This section has been modified by section 105A, added by referendum in 1928.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 105A - Agreements with respect to State debts

**Original Text:**
> (1) The Commonwealth may make agreements with the States with respect to the public debts of the States, including—
> 
> (a) the taking over of such debts by the Commonwealth;
> 
> (b) the management of such debts;
> 
> (c) the payment of interest and the provision and management of sinking funds in respect of such debts;
> 
> (d) the consolidation, renewal, conversion, and redemption of such debts;
> 
> (e) the indemnification of the Commonwealth by the States in respect of debts taken over by the Commonwealth; and
> 
> (f) the borrowing of money by the States or by the Commonwealth, or by the Commonwealth for the States.
> 
> (2) The Parliament may make laws for validating any such agreement made before the commencement of this section.
> 
> (3) The Parliament may make laws for the carrying out by the parties thereto of any such agreement.
> 
> (4) Any such agreement may be varied or rescinded by the parties thereto.
> 
> (5) Every such agreement and any such variation thereof shall be binding upon the Commonwealth and the States parties thereto notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution or the Constitution of the several States or in any law of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or of any State.
> 
> (6) The powers conferred by this section shall not be construed as being limited in any way by the provisions of section one hundred and five of this Constitution.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth can make agreements with the states about state public debts, including:
- The Commonwealth taking over state debts
- Managing state debts
- Paying interest and managing sinking funds for the debts
- Consolidating, renewing, converting, or redeeming the debts
- States compensating the Commonwealth for debts it takes over
- Borrowing money by the states or by the Commonwealth (including the Commonwealth borrowing on behalf of states)

Parliament can make laws to:
- Validate agreements made before this section was added to the Constitution
- Implement these agreements

The parties can vary or cancel these agreements. The agreements are binding on the Commonwealth and states despite anything in the Commonwealth or state constitutions or laws. These powers are not limited by section 105.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.
