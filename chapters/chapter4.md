# Chapter IV - Finance and Trade

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter IV of the Australian Constitution deals with financial and economic matters, including taxation, revenue, trade, and the financial relationships between the Commonwealth and the states. This chapter includes Sections 81-105.

### Section 81 - Consolidated Revenue Fund

**Original Text:**
> All revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution.

**Plain English:**
All money received by the Commonwealth government (such as taxes and other revenue) goes into one fund called the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Money can only be spent from this fund for Commonwealth purposes, and in accordance with the rules set out in the Constitution.

This section establishes a central government treasury and creates a requirement that government spending must be authorized by law.

**Key Cases:**
- **Pape v Commissioner of Taxation (2009)**: The High Court confirmed that money can only be spent from the Consolidated Revenue Fund if appropriated for a purpose within the Commonwealth's constitutional powers.

### Section 82 - Expenditure charged thereon

**Original Text:**
> The costs, charges, and expenses incident to the collection, management, and receipt of the Consolidated Revenue Fund shall form the first charge thereon; and the revenue of the Commonwealth shall in the first instance be applied to the payment of the expenditure of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The costs of collecting, managing, and receiving the Consolidated Revenue Fund are the first priority for payment from the fund. After that, the Commonwealth's own expenses must be paid before any other spending.

This section establishes priorities for government spending.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 83 - Money to be appropriated by law

**Original Text:**
> No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law.
> 
> But until the expiration of one month after the first meeting of the Parliament the Governor-General in Council may draw from the Treasury and expend such moneys as may be necessary for the maintenance of any department transferred to the Commonwealth and for the holding of the first elections for the Parliament.

**Plain English:**
Money can only be taken from the Commonwealth Treasury if Parliament has passed a law authorizing the spending. 

However, in the first month after the first Parliament met, the Governor-General in Council could spend money necessary to run the departments transferred to the Commonwealth and to hold the first federal elections.

This section establishes the principle that Parliament controls government spending.

**Key Cases:**
- **Brown v West (1990)**: The High Court considered what constitutes a valid appropriation under Section 83.

### Section 84 - Transfer of officers

**Original Text:**
> When any department of the public service of a State is transferred to the Commonwealth:
> 
> (i) All officers of the department shall become subject to the control of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth.
> 
> (ii) All property of the State of any kind, used exclusively in connection with the department, shall become vested in the Commonwealth; but, in the case of the departments controlling customs and excise and bounties, for such time only as the Governor-General in Council may declare to be necessary.
> 
> (iii) The Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State, of any kind used, but not exclusively used in connection with the department; the value thereof shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in, as nearly as may be, the manner in which the value of land, or of an interest in land, taken by the State for public purposes is ascertained under the law of the State in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth.
> 
> (iv) The Commonwealth shall compensate the State for the value of any property passing to the Commonwealth under this section; if no agreement can be made as to the mode of compensation, it shall be determined under laws to be made by the Parliament.
> 
> (v) The Commonwealth shall, at the date of the transfer, assume the current obligations of the State in respect of the department transferred.

**Plain English:**
When a state department is transferred to the Commonwealth:
1. All department staff become Commonwealth employees under the control of the Commonwealth Executive Government.
2. All property exclusively used by the department becomes Commonwealth property (for customs, excise, and bounties departments, only for as long as necessary).
3. The Commonwealth can acquire any property partly used by the department, paying a value determined as per State land acquisition laws if no agreement can be reached.
4. The Commonwealth must compensate the State for any property transferred. If they can't agree on compensation, Parliament will make laws to determine it.
5. The Commonwealth takes over all current obligations of the department at the time of transfer.

This section managed the practical aspects of transferring state departments to the Commonwealth after Federation.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 85 - Transfer of property of State

**Original Text:**
> When any department of the public service of a State is transferred to the Commonwealth:
> 
> (i) All property of the State of any kind, used exclusively in connection with the department, shall become vested in the Commonwealth; but, in the case of the departments controlling customs and excise and bounties, for such time only as the Governor-General in Council may declare to be necessary.
> 
> (ii) The Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State, of any kind used, but not exclusively used in connection with the department; the value thereof shall, if no agreement can be made, be ascertained in, as nearly as may be, the manner in which the value of land, or of an interest in land, taken by the State for public purposes is ascertained under the law of the State in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth.
> 
> (iii) The Commonwealth shall compensate the State for the value of any property passing to the Commonwealth under this section; if no agreement can be made as to the mode of compensation, it shall be determined under laws to be made by the Parliament.
> 
> (iv) The Commonwealth shall, at the date of the transfer, assume the current obligations of the State in respect of the department transferred.

**Plain English:**
This section repeats the property transfer provisions from Section 84, specifying how property transfers from States to the Commonwealth when a State department is transferred.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 86 - [Collection of existing duties of customs and excise]

**Original Text:**
> On the establishment of the Commonwealth, the collection and control of duties of customs and of excise, and the control of the payment of bounties, shall pass to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
From the establishment of the Commonwealth, the Commonwealth government took over the collection and control of customs and excise duties, as well as the control of bounty payments.

This section transferred important revenue-raising powers to the new federal government.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 87 - [Grant of two-thirds of customs and excise revenue to States for 10 years]

**Original Text:**
> During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of customs and of excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure.
> 
> The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
For the first ten years after Federation, and until Parliament decided otherwise, the Commonwealth could only use up to one-quarter of the net revenue from customs and excise duties for its own expenses. The remaining three-quarters had to be paid to the States or used to pay interest on State debts taken over by the Commonwealth.

This temporary arrangement (known as the "Braddon Clause" or "Braddon Blot") ensured States received substantial revenue following Federation, when they lost their customs and excise revenue powers.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 88 - Uniform duties of customs

**Original Text:**
> Uniform duties of customs shall be imposed within two years after the establishment of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth had to establish uniform customs duties across all States within two years of Federation.

This created a customs union and ended the colonial-era practice of imposing tariffs on goods moving between colonies.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 89 - Payment to States before uniform duties

**Original Text:**
> Until the imposition of uniform duties of customs:
> 
> (i) The Commonwealth shall credit to each State the revenues collected therein by the Commonwealth.
> 
> (ii) The Commonwealth shall debit to each State:
> 
> (a) The expenditure therein of the Commonwealth incurred solely for the maintenance or continuance, as at the time of transfer, of any department transferred from the State to the Commonwealth;
> 
> (b) The proportion of the State, according to the number of its people, in the other expenditure of the Commonwealth.
> 
> (iii) The Commonwealth shall pay to each State month by month the balance (if any) in favour of the State.

**Plain English:**
Until uniform customs duties were imposed:
1. The Commonwealth credited each State with the revenue collected in that State.
2. The Commonwealth debited each State for:
   a. Commonwealth expenditure in that State for maintaining transferred departments; and
   b. That State's population-based share of other Commonwealth expenditure.
3. Each month, the Commonwealth paid any positive balance to the relevant State.

This section provided a transitional financial arrangement between Federation and the establishment of uniform customs duties.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 90 - Exclusive power over customs, excise, and bounties

**Original Text:**
> On the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive.
> 
> On the imposition of uniform duties of customs all laws of the several States imposing duties of customs or of excise, or offering bounties on the production or export of goods, shall cease to have effect, but any grant of or agreement for any such bounty lawfully made by or under the authority of the Government of any State shall be taken to be good if made before the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight, and not otherwise.

**Plain English:**
Once uniform customs duties were imposed:
1. Only the Commonwealth Parliament could impose customs and excise duties, and grant bounties on the production or export of goods.
2. All State laws imposing customs or excise duties, or offering bounties on production or export of goods, became invalid. However, any bounty granted or agreed to before June 30, 1898, remained valid.

This section gave the Commonwealth exclusive power over important revenue-raising measures and created a national economic space.

**Key Cases:**
- **Ha v New South Wales (1997)**: The High Court defined "excise" broadly to include any tax on goods at any stage of their production or distribution, effectively preventing States from taxing goods.

### Section 91 - Exceptions as to bounties

**Original Text:**
> Nothing in this Constitution prohibits a State from granting any aid to or bounty on mining for gold, silver, or other metals, nor from granting, with the consent of both Houses of the Parliament of the Commonwealth expressed by resolution, any aid to or bounty on the production or export of goods.

**Plain English:**
Despite Section 90, States can still:
1. Grant aid or bounties for mining gold, silver, or other metals
2. Grant aid or bounties on the production or export of goods if both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament consent to it by resolution

This section creates specific exceptions to the Commonwealth's exclusive power over bounties.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 92 - Trade within the Commonwealth to be free

**Original Text:**
> On the imposition of uniform duties of customs, trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States, whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free.
> 
> But notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, goods imported before the imposition of uniform duties of customs into any State, or into any Colony which, whilst the goods remain therein, becomes a State, shall, on thence passing into another State within two years after the imposition of such duties, be liable to any duty chargeable on the importation of such goods into the Commonwealth, less any duty paid in respect of the goods on their importation.

**Plain English:**
Once uniform customs duties were imposed:
1. Trade, commerce, and intercourse (movement) between the States must be absolutely free, whether by land transport or sea navigation.
2. However, goods imported into a State before uniform customs duties were imposed would be subject to Commonwealth import duties if they moved to another State within two years of uniform duties being imposed, less any duty already paid.

This section prohibits restrictions on interstate trade and was intended to create a single national market.

**Key Cases:**
- **Cole v Whitfield (1988)**: The High Court held that Section 92 prohibits laws that discriminate against interstate trade and commerce and protect intrastate trade and commerce.
- **Betfair Pty Ltd v Western Australia (2008)**: Applied the Cole v Whitfield test to laws regulating internet gambling.

### Section 93 - Payment to States for five years after uniform Tariffs

**Original Text:**
> During the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides:
> 
> (i) The duties of customs chargeable on goods imported into a State and afterwards passing into another State for consumption, and the duties of excise paid on goods produced or manufactured in a State and afterwards passing into another State for consumption, shall be taken to have been collected not in the former but in the latter State:
> 
> (ii) Subject to the last subsection, the Commonwealth shall credit revenue, debit expenditure, and pay balances to the several States as prescribed for the period preceding the imposition of uniform duties of customs.

**Plain English:**
For the first five years after uniform customs duties were imposed, and until Parliament decided otherwise:
1. Customs duties on goods imported into one State and then moved to another State for consumption, and excise duties on goods produced in one State and moved to another State for consumption, were treated as if they had been collected in the State where the goods were consumed, not where they entered Australia or were produced.
2. Otherwise, the Commonwealth continued to credit revenue, debit expenditure, and pay balances to States as it had before uniform duties were imposed.

This section created another transitional financial arrangement after uniform customs duties were imposed.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 94 - Distribution of surplus

**Original Text:**
> After five years from the imposition of uniform duties of customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
Five years after uniform customs duties were imposed, Parliament could decide how to distribute any surplus Commonwealth revenue to the States on whatever basis it considered fair.

This section allowed Parliament to determine financial arrangements with the States after the initial transitional period.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 95 - Customs duties of Western Australia

**Original Text:**
> Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the Parliament of the State of Western Australia, if that State be an Original State, may, during the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of customs, impose duties of customs on goods passing into that State and not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth; and such duties shall be collected by the Commonwealth.
> 
> But any duty so imposed on any goods shall not exceed during the first of such years the duty chargeable on the goods under the law of Western Australia in force at the imposition of uniform duties, and shall not exceed during the second, third, fourth, and fifth of such years respectively, four-fifths, three-fifths, two-fifths, and one-fifth of such latter duty, and all duties imposed under this section shall cease at the expiration of the fifth year after the imposition of uniform duties.
> 
> If at any time during the five years the duty on any goods under this section is higher than the duty imposed by the Commonwealth on the importation of the like goods, then such higher duty shall be collected on the goods when imported into Western Australia from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
Despite other provisions in the Constitution, Western Australia (as an Original State) could, for the first five years after uniform customs duties were imposed, charge customs duties on goods brought into Western Australia from other parts of Australia (but not on goods imported directly from overseas). These duties would be collected by the Commonwealth.

However, these WA duties were limited:
1. In the first year, they couldn't exceed WA's pre-Federation duties
2. In the second year, they couldn't exceed 4/5 of pre-Federation duties
3. In the third year, they couldn't exceed 3/5 of pre-Federation duties
4. In the fourth year, they couldn't exceed 2/5 of pre-Federation duties
5. In the fifth year, they couldn't exceed 1/5 of pre-Federation duties
6. After five years, all such duties had to end

If WA's duty on goods was higher than the Commonwealth's import duty on the same goods, then the higher duty would be collected when those goods were imported directly into WA from overseas.

This special arrangement recognized Western Australia's unique economic situation at Federation due to its distance from other States.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 96 - Financial assistance to States

**Original Text:**
> During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit.

**Plain English:**
For the first ten years after Federation, and thereafter until Parliament decides otherwise, Parliament can grant financial assistance to any State on whatever terms and conditions Parliament decides.

This section has become one of the most important in the Constitution, allowing the Commonwealth to influence State policies by attaching conditions to grants of money.

**Key Cases:**
- **Victoria v Commonwealth (1957)** ("Second Uniform Tax Case"): The High Court confirmed that the Commonwealth can attach conditions to grants made to States under Section 96.

### Section 97 - Audit

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the laws in force in any Colony which has become or becomes a State with respect to the receipt of revenue and the expenditure of money on account of the Government of the Colony, and the review and audit of such receipt and expenditure, shall apply to the receipt of revenue and the expenditure of money on account of the Commonwealth in the State in the same manner as if the Commonwealth, or the Government or an officer of the Commonwealth, were mentioned whenever the Colony, or the Government or an officer of the Colony, is mentioned.

**Plain English:**
Until Parliament made its own laws on the subject, the colony/state laws about government revenue, expenditure, and auditing would apply to Commonwealth revenue and expenditure in that State.

This section provided another transitional arrangement until the Commonwealth established its own financial management systems.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 98 - Trade and commerce includes navigation and State railways

**Original Text:**
> The power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of any State.

**Plain English:**
Parliament's power to make laws about trade and commerce includes making laws about:
1. Navigation and shipping
2. Railways owned by any State

This section clarifies that the Commonwealth's trade and commerce power extends to specific transportation methods, including state-owned railways.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 99 - Commonwealth not to give preference

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth must not make laws or regulations about trade, commerce, or revenue that favor one State (or part of a State) over another State (or part of a State).

This section aims to ensure that the Commonwealth treats all States equally in economic matters.

**Key Cases:**
None directly interpreting this section, though it has been raised in some cases.

### Section 100 - Nor abridge right to use water

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth must not make laws or regulations about trade or commerce that restrict the right of a State or its residents to reasonably use river water for conservation or irrigation.

This section protects States' rights to water resources, an important issue in Australia's dry climate.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 101 - Inter-State Commission

**Original Text:**
> There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and of all laws made thereunder.

**Plain English:**
There shall be an Inter-State Commission with powers of judgment and administration as Parliament considers necessary to execute and maintain the Constitution's provisions relating to trade and commerce, and all laws made under those provisions.

Although provided for in the Constitution, the Inter-State Commission only existed from 1913 to 1920, and briefly in the 1980s.

**Key Cases:**
- **New South Wales v Commonwealth (1915)** ("Wheat Case"): The High Court held that the Inter-State Commission could not exercise judicial power.

### Section 102 - Parliament may forbid preferences by State

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or commerce forbid, as to railways, any preference or discrimination by any State, or by any authority constituted under a State, if such preference or discrimination is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State; due regard being had to the financial responsibilities incurred by any State in connection with the construction and maintenance of its railways. But no preference or discrimination shall, within the meaning of this section, be taken to be undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State, unless so adjudged by the Inter-State Commission.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can make laws about trade or commerce that prohibit States or State authorities from giving unfair preferences or discriminating in railway matters, if such preference or discrimination is unreasonable or unjust to any State. However, the financial responsibilities of States in building and maintaining railways must be taken into account.

No preference or discrimination will be considered unreasonable or unjust unless the Inter-State Commission judges it to be so.

This section was designed to prevent unfair railway competition between States.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 103 - Commissioners' appointment, tenure, and remuneration

**Original Text:**
> The members of the Inter-State Commission:
> 
> (i) Shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council:
> 
> (ii) Shall hold office for seven years, but may be removed within that time by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session praying for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity:
> 
> (iii) Shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; but such remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.

**Plain English:**
Members of the Inter-State Commission:
1. Are appointed by the Governor-General in Council
2. Serve for seven years, but can be removed if both Houses of Parliament agree in the same session, and only for proven misbehavior or incapacity
3. Receive a salary set by Parliament, which cannot be reduced during their term

These provisions were designed to ensure the independence of the Inter-State Commission.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 104 - Saving of certain rates

**Original Text:**
> Nothing in this Constitution shall render unlawful any rate for the carriage of goods upon a railway, the property of a State, if the rate is deemed by the Inter-State Commission to be necessary for the development of the territory of the State, and if the rate applies equally to goods within the State and to goods passing into the State from other States.

**Plain English:**
Nothing in the Constitution makes it unlawful for a State-owned railway to charge a particular rate for carrying goods if:
1. The Inter-State Commission considers the rate necessary for developing the State's territory; and
2. The rate applies equally to goods within the State and goods coming into the State from other States.

This section created an exception to the prohibition on discriminatory rates.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 105 - Taking over public debts of States

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may take over from the States their public debts, or a proportion thereof according to the respective numbers of their people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, and may convert, renew, or consolidate such debts, or any part thereof; and the States shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the debts taken over, and thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debts shall be deducted and retained from the portions of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth payable to the several States, or if such surplus is insufficient, or if there is no surplus, then the deficiency or the whole amount shall be paid by the several States.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can take over all or part of State public debts, based on the population of each State. The Commonwealth can convert, renew, or consolidate these debts.

The States must compensate the Commonwealth for the debts taken over. The interest on these debts will be deducted from the surplus revenue paid to the States by the Commonwealth. If there is not enough surplus revenue, or no surplus, the States must pay the shortfall.

This section allowed for Commonwealth management of State debts, which was seen as potentially more efficient.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 105A - Agreements with respect to State debts

[This section was added by referendum in 1928 and deals with financial agreements between the Commonwealth and States regarding public debts.]

**Original Text:**
> (1) The Commonwealth may make agreements with the States with respect to the public debts of the States, including:
> 
> (a) the taking over of such debts by the Commonwealth;
> 
> (b) the management of such debts;
> 
> (c) the payment of interest and the provision and management of sinking funds in respect of such debts;
> 
> (d) the consolidation, renewal, conversion, and redemption of such debts;
> 
> (e) the indemnification of the Commonwealth by the States in respect of debts taken over by the Commonwealth; and
> 
> (f) the borrowing of money by the States or by the Commonwealth, or by the Commonwealth for the States.
> 
> (2) The Parliament may make laws for validating any such agreement made before the commencement of this section.
> 
> (3) The Parliament may make laws for the carrying out by the parties thereto of any such agreement.
> 
> (4) Any such agreement may be varied or rescinded by the parties thereto.
> 
> (5) Every such agreement and any such variation thereof shall be binding upon the Commonwealth and the States parties thereto notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution or the Constitution of the several States or in any law of the Parliament of the Commonwealth or of any State.
> 
> (6) The powers conferred by this section shall not be construed as being limited in any way by the provisions of section one hundred and five of this Constitution.

**Plain English:**
1. The Commonwealth can make agreements with the States about State public debts, including:
   a. The Commonwealth taking over the debts
   b. Managing the debts
   c. Paying interest and managing sinking funds for the debts
   d. Consolidating, renewing, converting, or redeeming the debts
   e. States compensating the Commonwealth for debts it takes over
   f. Borrowing by the States or by the Commonwealth, or by the Commonwealth for the States

2. Parliament can make laws to validate any such agreement made before this section came into effect.

3. Parliament can make laws to implement these agreements.

4. The agreements can be changed or canceled if all parties agree.

5. These agreements and any changes to them are binding on the Commonwealth and the States involved, regardless of anything in the Constitution, State Constitutions, or Commonwealth or State laws.

6. The powers in this section are not limited by Section 105.

This section, added in 1928, facilitated the Financial Agreement of that year between the Commonwealth and States, creating a Loan Council to coordinate public borrowing.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.
