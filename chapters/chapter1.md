# Chapter I - The Parliament

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter I of the Australian Constitution establishes the legislative branch of the Australian government, called the Parliament. This chapter is the largest in the Constitution and is divided into five parts:

1. **Part I - General** (Sections 1-6): Establishes the basic structure of Parliament and the role of the Governor-General.
2. **Part II - The Senate** (Sections 7-23): Covers the composition, powers, and procedures of the Senate.
3. **Part III - House of Representatives** (Sections 24-40): Covers the composition, powers, and procedures of the House of Representatives.
4. **Part IV - Both Houses of the Parliament** (Sections 41-50): Deals with matters common to both houses.
5. **Part V - Powers of the Parliament** (Sections 51-60): Outlines the legislative powers of Parliament.

## Part I - General (Sections 1-6)

### Section 1 - Legislative Power

**Original Text:**
> The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives, and which is hereinafter called "The Parliament," or "The Parliament of the Commonwealth."

**Plain English:**
This section establishes that the power to make laws for Australia belongs to the Federal Parliament, which consists of three parts:
1. The Queen (represented by the Governor-General)
2. The Senate
3. The House of Representatives

This three-part structure is known as a bicameral parliament (with two houses) under a constitutional monarchy.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 2 - Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in the Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasure, but subject to this Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as Her Majesty may be pleased to assign to him.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General is appointed by the Queen to be her representative in Australia. The Governor-General has the powers and functions that the Queen gives them, but must exercise these powers according to the Constitution.

**Key Cases:**
- **FAI Insurances Ltd v Winneke (1982)**: Clarified that the Governor-General (and state governors) must act according to procedural fairness when exercising certain powers.

### Section 3 - Salary of Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> There shall be payable to the Queen out of the Consolidated Revenue fund of the Commonwealth, for the salary of the Governor-General, an annual sum which, until the Parliament otherwise provides, shall be ten thousand pounds. The salary of a Governor-General shall not be altered during his continuance in office.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General receives a salary from the Australian government. Initially set at 10,000 pounds per year, Parliament can change this amount, but cannot change the salary of a Governor-General while they are in office.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 4 - Provisions relating to Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> The provisions of this Constitution relating to the Governor-General extend and apply to the Governor-General for the time being, or such person as the Queen may appoint to administer the Government of the Commonwealth; but no such person shall be entitled to receive any salary from the Commonwealth in respect of any other office during his administration of the Government of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The constitutional provisions about the Governor-General apply to whoever is currently in that role, or to any person the Queen appoints to temporarily administer the Australian government. However, that person cannot receive a salary for any other government office while they are acting as Governor-General.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 5 - Sessions of Parliament, prorogation and dissolution

**Original Text:**
> The Governor-General may appoint such times for holding the sessions of the Parliament as he thinks fit, and may also from time to time, by Proclamation or otherwise, prorogue the Parliament, and may in like manner dissolve the House of Representatives.
> 
> After any general election the Parliament shall be summoned to meet not later than thirty days after the day appointed for the return of the writs.
> 
> The Parliament shall be summoned to meet not later than six months after the establishment of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General decides when Parliament meets. They can:
- Call Parliament into session
- Temporarily suspend Parliament (prorogation)
- Dissolve the House of Representatives (which triggers an election)

After an election, Parliament must meet within 30 days of the election results being declared. When Australia was first established as a federation, Parliament had to meet within six months.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 6 - Yearly session of Parliament

**Original Text:**
> There shall be a session of the Parliament once at least in every year, so that twelve months shall not intervene between the last sitting of the Parliament in one session and its first sitting in the next session.

**Plain English:**
Parliament must meet at least once every year, and no more than 12 months can pass between one session and the next.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Part II - The Senate (Sections 7-23)

### Section 7 - The Senate

**Original Text:**
> The Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, directly chosen by the people of the State, voting, until the Parliament otherwise provides, as one electorate.
> 
> But until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of the State of Queensland, if that State be an Original State, may make laws dividing the State into divisions and determining the number of senators to be chosen for each division, and in the absence of such provision the State shall be one electorate.
> 
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides there shall be six senators for each Original State. The Parliament may make laws increasing or diminishing the number of senators for each State, but so that equal representation of the several Original States shall be maintained and that no Original State shall have less than six senators.
> 
> The senators shall be chosen for a term of six years, and the names of the senators chosen for each State shall be certified by the Governor to the Governor-General.

**Plain English:**
The Senate includes senators from each state who are directly elected by the people of that state. Each state votes as one electorate (though Queensland initially had a special provision allowing it to be divided into multiple electorates). 

Originally, each state had six senators. Parliament can change this number, but must ensure:
- Each original state has the same number of senators
- No original state has fewer than six senators

Senators are elected for six-year terms.

**Key Cases:**
- **Western Australia v Commonwealth (1975)** ("Territories Representation Case"): The High Court upheld the validity of legislation providing for senators to represent territories (under section 122), even though this resulted in unequal representation across states and territories.

### Section 8 - Qualification of electors

**Original Text:**
> The qualification of electors of senators shall be in each State that which is prescribed by this Constitution, or by the Parliament, as the qualification for electors of members of the House of Representatives; but in the choosing of senators each elector shall vote only once.

**Plain English:**
The qualifications for people to vote for senators are the same as those for voting for members of the House of Representatives. Each voter can only vote once in a Senate election.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 9 - Method of election of senators

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws prescribing the method of choosing senators, but so that the method shall be uniform for all the States. Subject to any such law, the Parliament of each State may make laws prescribing the method of choosing the senators for that State.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth Parliament can make laws about how senators are elected, but the method must be the same for all states. If the Commonwealth hasn't made such laws, each state parliament can make laws about how senators for that state are elected.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 10 - Application of State laws

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, but subject to this Constitution, the laws in force in each State, for the time being, relating to elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of the State shall, as nearly as practicable, apply to elections of senators for the State.

**Plain English:**
Until the Commonwealth Parliament makes laws about Senate elections, the laws of each state regarding elections for their lower house (the larger of the two houses of state Parliament) will apply to Senate elections in that state, as much as is practical.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 11 - Failure to choose senators

**Original Text:**
> The Senate may proceed to the despatch of business, notwithstanding the failure of any State to provide for its representation in the Senate.

**Plain English:**
The Senate can still operate and conduct business even if a state fails to elect senators.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 12 - Issue of writs

**Original Text:**
> The Governor of any State may cause writs to be issued for elections of senators for the State. In case of the dissolution of the Senate the writs shall be issued within ten days from the proclamation of such dissolution.

**Plain English:**
The Governor of a state can issue writs (formal written orders) for Senate elections in that state. If the Senate is dissolved, writs must be issued within 10 days of the dissolution being proclaimed.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 13 - Rotation of senators

**Original Text:**
> As soon as may be after the Senate first meets, and after each first meeting of the Senate following a dissolution thereof, the Senate shall divide the senators chosen for each State into two classes, as nearly equal in number as practicable; and the places of the senators of the first class shall become vacant at the expiration of the third year, and the places of those of the second class at the expiration of the sixth year, from the beginning of their term of service; and afterwards the places of senators shall become vacant at the expiration of six years from the beginning of their term of service.

> The election to fill vacant places shall be made in the year at the expiration of which the places are to become vacant.

> For the purposes of this section the term of service of a senator shall be taken to begin on the first day of July following the day of his election, except in the cases of the first election and of the election next after any dissolution of the Senate, when it shall be taken to begin on the first day of July preceding the day of his election.

**Plain English:**
This section originally established a rotation system for senators. After the first Senate meeting, senators from each state were divided into two groups:
- The first group's term ended after 3 years
- The second group's term ended after 6 years

After that, all senators served 6-year terms, with half of the senators from each state facing election every 3 years.

Elections to fill Senate vacancies must be held in the year that the vacancies will occur.

A senator's term of service normally begins on July 1 after their election, but for the first Senate and after a dissolution of the Senate, terms start on July 1 before the election.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 14 - Further provision for rotation

**Original Text:**
> Whenever the number of senators for a State is increased or diminished, the Parliament of the Commonwealth may make such provision for the vacating of the places of senators for the State as it deems necessary to maintain regularity in the rotation.

**Plain English:**
If the number of senators for a state changes, the Commonwealth Parliament can make rules about which senators must vacate their seats to maintain the regular rotation system (where half the senators from each state face election every 3 years).

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 15 - Casual vacancies

**Original Text:**
> If the place of a senator becomes vacant before the expiration of his term of service, the Houses of Parliament of the State for which he was chosen shall, sitting and voting together, choose a person to hold the place until the expiration of the term, or until the election of a successor as hereinafter provided, whichever first happens. But if the Houses of Parliament of the State are not in session at the time when the vacancy is notified, the Governor of the State, with the advice of the Executive Council thereof, may appoint a person to hold the place until the expiration of fourteen days after the beginning of the next session of the Parliament of the State, or until the election of a successor, whichever first happens.

> At the next general election of members of the House of Representatives, or at the next election of senators for the State, whichever first happens, a successor shall, if the term has not then expired, be chosen to hold the place from the date of his election until the expiration of the term.

> The name of any senator so chosen or appointed shall be certified by the Governor of the State to the Governor-General.

**Plain English:**
This section has been amended since Federation. Originally, it provided that if a Senate seat becomes vacant before the end of the term:

1. The state parliament, with both houses sitting together, would choose a replacement to serve until:
   - The end of the original senator's term, or
   - Until a successor was elected at the next general election or Senate election, whichever came first

2. If the state parliament was not in session, the state Governor could appoint someone to hold the place temporarily until:
   - 14 days after the state parliament's next session began, or
   - Until a successor was elected, whichever came first

3. At the next general election or Senate election for that state, a successor would be elected to serve the remainder of the term if it hadn't yet expired.

The state Governor must notify the Governor-General of any senator chosen or appointed.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 16 - Qualifications of senator

**Original Text:**
> The qualifications of a senator shall be the same as those of a member of the House of Representatives.

**Plain English:**
To be eligible to be a senator, a person must meet the same requirements as for being a member of the House of Representatives.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 17 - Election of President

**Original Text:**
> The Senate shall, before proceeding to the despatch of any other business, choose a senator to be the President of the Senate; and as often as the office of President becomes vacant the Senate shall again choose a senator to be the President.

> The President shall cease to hold his office if he ceases to be a senator. He may be removed from office by a vote of the Senate, or he may resign his office or his seat by writing addressed to the Governor-General.

**Plain English:**
The Senate must elect one of its members to be the President of the Senate before it does any other business. Whenever the position becomes vacant, the Senate must elect a new President.

A person ceases to be President if they:
- Stop being a senator
- Are removed from office by a Senate vote
- Resign as President or senator (by writing to the Governor-General)

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 18 - Absence of President

**Original Text:**
> Before or during any absence of the President, the Senate may choose a senator to perform his duties in his absence.

**Plain English:**
If the President is absent, the Senate may choose another senator to take over the President's duties temporarily.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 19 - Resignation of senator

**Original Text:**
> A senator may, by writing addressed to the President, or to the Governor-General if there is no President or if the President is absent from the Commonwealth, resign his place, which thereupon shall become vacant.

**Plain English:**
A senator can resign by writing to the President of the Senate or, if there is no President or the President is absent from Australia, by writing to the Governor-General. Their Senate seat then becomes vacant.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 20 - Vacancy by absence

**Original Text:**
> The place of a senator shall become vacant if for two consecutive months of any session of the Parliament he, without the permission of the Senate, fails to attend the Senate.

**Plain English:**
A senator's seat becomes vacant if they miss Senate meetings for two consecutive months during any parliamentary session without the Senate's permission.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 21 - Vacancy to be notified

**Original Text:**
> Whenever a vacancy happens in the Senate, the President, or if there is no President or if the President is absent from the Commonwealth the Governor-General, shall notify the same to the Governor of the State in the representation of which the vacancy has happened.

**Plain English:**
When a Senate seat becomes vacant, the President of the Senate (or the Governor-General if there is no President or if the President is not in Australia) must notify the Governor of the state that the senator represented.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 22 - Quorum

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the presence of at least one-third of the whole number of the senators shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the Senate for the exercise of its powers.

**Plain English:**
Unless Parliament makes a different rule, at least one-third of all senators must be present for the Senate to conduct business.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 23 - Voting in Senate

**Original Text:**
> Questions arising in the Senate shall be determined by a majority of votes, and each senator shall have one vote. The President shall in all cases be entitled to a vote; and when the votes are equal the question shall pass in the negative.

**Plain English:**
Decisions in the Senate are made by majority vote, with each senator having one vote. The President of the Senate can also vote (unlike the Speaker in the House of Representatives, who normally doesn't vote). If there is a tie, the motion fails.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Part III - The House of Representatives (Sections 24-40)

### Section 24 - Constitution of House of Representatives

**Original Text:**
> The House of Representatives shall be composed of members directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth, and the number of such members shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of the senators.

> The number of members chosen in the several States shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of their people, and shall, until the Parliament otherwise provides, be determined, whenever necessary, in the following manner:
> (i) a quota shall be ascertained by dividing the number of the people of the Commonwealth, as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, by twice the number of the senators;
> (ii) the number of members to be chosen in each State shall be determined by dividing the number of the people of the State, as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, by the quota; and if on such division there is a remainder greater than one-half of the quota, one more member shall be chosen in the State.

> But notwithstanding anything in this section, five members at least shall be chosen in each Original State.

**Plain English:**
The House of Representatives consists of members directly elected by the Australian people. The total number of members should be approximately twice the number of senators.

Each state gets a number of representatives proportional to its population. The formula to work this out is:
1. Calculate a quota by dividing Australia's population by twice the number of senators
2. For each state, divide its population by this quota
3. If there's a remainder greater than half of the quota, that state gets one more member

Each original state (the six states that formed the Federation) must have at least five representatives, regardless of its population.

**Key Cases:**
- **McKinlay v Commonwealth (1975)**: The High Court held that section 24 does not require exact equality of population between electoral divisions.

### Section 25 - Provision as to races disqualified from voting

**Original Text:**
> For the purposes of the last section, if by the law of any State all persons of any race are disqualified from voting at elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of the State, then, in reckoning the number of the people of the State or of the Commonwealth, persons of that race resident in that State shall not be counted.

**Plain English:**
This section (now obsolete) provided that if a state disqualified all people of a particular race from voting for the state's lower house, then people of that race in that state would not be counted when calculating how many House of Representatives members the state should have.

This section was particularly relevant when Aboriginal Australians were denied the right to vote in some states, but it no longer has practical effect.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 26 - Representatives in first Parliament

**Original Text:**
> Notwithstanding anything in section twenty-four, the number of members to be chosen in each State at the first election shall be as follows:
> New South Wales, twenty-three;
> Victoria, twenty;
> Queensland, eight;
> South Australia, six;
> Tasmania, five.
> Provided that if Western Australia is an Original State, the numbers shall be as follows:
> New South Wales, twenty-six;
> Victoria, twenty-three;
> Queensland, nine;
> South Australia, seven;
> Western Australia, five;
> Tasmania, five.

**Plain English:**
This section (now obsolete) specified the number of representatives each state would have in the first Parliament. It set out two scenarios: one if Western Australia did not join as an original state, and another if it did.

Western Australia did join as an original state, so the second set of numbers applied.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 27 - Alteration of number of members

**Original Text:**
> Subject to this Constitution, the Parliament may make laws for increasing or diminishing the number of the members of the House of Representatives.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can make laws to increase or decrease the number of members in the House of Representatives, as long as it obeys other constitutional requirements (such as the requirement that the number be about twice the number of senators, and each state have a number proportional to its population).

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 28 - Duration of House of Representatives

**Original Text:**
> Every House of Representatives shall continue for three years from the first meeting of the House, and no longer, but may be sooner dissolved by the Governor-General.

**Plain English:**
Each House of Representatives lasts for three years from its first meeting, unless the Governor-General dissolves it earlier. After three years, it automatically ceases to exist.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 29 - Electoral divisions

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of any State may make laws for determining the divisions in each State for which members of the House of Representatives may be chosen, and the number of members to be chosen for each division. A division shall not be formed out of parts of different States.

> In the absence of other provision, each State shall be one electorate.

**Plain English:**
Until the Commonwealth Parliament makes different rules, state parliaments can make laws about the electoral divisions within their state for the House of Representatives, including how many members are elected from each division.

A division cannot include parts of different states.

If no laws are made about divisions, each state is treated as one electorate.

**Key Cases:**
- **Attorney-General (Cth); Ex rel McKinlay v Commonwealth (1975)**: The High Court held that the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, which established a system of single-member electoral divisions, was a valid exercise of power under this section.

### Section 30 - Qualification of electors

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the qualification of electors of members of the House of Representatives shall be in each State that which is prescribed by the law of the State as the qualification for electors of the more numerous House of Parliament of the State; but in the choosing of members each elector shall vote only once.

**Plain English:**
Until the Commonwealth Parliament makes different rules, the qualifications for voting in House of Representatives elections in each state are the same as the qualifications for voting in elections for the lower house of the state parliament.

Each voter can only vote once in a House of Representatives election.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 31 - Application of State laws

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, but subject to this Constitution, the laws in force in each State for the time being relating to elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of the State shall, as nearly as practicable, apply to elections in the State of members of the House of Representatives.

**Plain English:**
Until the Commonwealth Parliament makes different rules, the laws of each state regarding elections for their lower house will apply to House of Representatives elections in that state, as much as is practical.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 32 - Writs for general election

**Original Text:**
> The Governor-General in Council may cause writs to be issued for general elections of members of the House of Representatives.

> After the first general election, the writs shall be issued within ten days from the expiry of a House of Representatives or from the proclamation of a dissolution thereof.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council, can issue writs (formal written orders) for general elections for the House of Representatives.

After the first general election, writs must be issued within 10 days of:
- The automatic expiry of the House of Representatives (after three years), or
- The proclamation of the dissolution of the House of Representatives

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 33 - Writs for vacancies

**Original Text:**
> Whenever a vacancy happens in the House of Representatives, the Speaker shall issue his writ for the election of a new member, or if there is no Speaker or if he is absent from the Commonwealth the Governor-General in Council may issue the writ.

**Plain English:**
When a seat in the House of Representatives becomes vacant, the Speaker issues a writ for a by-election to fill the vacancy. If there is no Speaker or the Speaker is not in Australia, the Governor-General (acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council) may issue the writ.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 34 - Qualifications of members

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the qualifications of a member of the House of Representatives shall be as follows:
> (i) he must be of the full age of twenty-one years, and must be an elector entitled to vote at the election of members of the House of Representatives, or a person qualified to become such elector, and must have been for three years at the least a resident within the limits of the Commonwealth as existing at the time when he is chosen;
> (ii) he must be a subject of the Queen, either natural-born or for at least five years naturalized under a law of the United Kingdom, or of a Colony which has become or becomes a State, or of the Commonwealth, or of a State.

**Plain English:**
Until Parliament makes different rules, to be a member of the House of Representatives, a person must:
1. Be at least 21 years old
2. Be eligible to vote in House of Representatives elections (or be qualified to become eligible)
3. Have lived in Australia for at least three years
4. Be a subject of the Queen, either by birth or by naturalization for at least five years

Parliament has changed these qualifications in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, reducing the minimum age to 18 and changing citizenship requirements.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 35 - Election of Speaker

**Original Text:**
> The House of Representatives shall, before proceeding to the despatch of any other business, choose a member to be the Speaker of the House, and as often as the office of Speaker becomes vacant the House shall again choose a member to be the Speaker.

> The Speaker shall cease to hold his office if he ceases to be a member. He may be removed from office by a vote of the House, or he may resign his office or his seat by writing addressed to the Governor-General.

**Plain English:**
The House of Representatives must elect one of its members as Speaker before it does any other business. Whenever the position becomes vacant, the House must elect a new Speaker.

A person ceases to be Speaker if they:
- Stop being a member of the House
- Are removed from office by a House vote
- Resign as Speaker or as a member (by writing to the Governor-General)

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 36 - Absence of Speaker

**Original Text:**
> Before or during any absence of the Speaker, the House of Representatives may choose a member to perform his duties in his absence.

**Plain English:**
If the Speaker is absent, the House of Representatives may choose another member to take over the Speaker's duties temporarily.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 37 - Resignation of member

**Original Text:**
> A member may by writing addressed to the Speaker, or to the Governor-General if there is no Speaker or if the Speaker is absent from the Commonwealth, resign his place, which thereupon shall become vacant.

**Plain English:**
A member of the House of Representatives can resign by writing to the Speaker or, if there is no Speaker or the Speaker is absent from Australia, by writing to the Governor-General. Their seat then becomes vacant.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 38 - Vacancy by absence

**Original Text:**
> The place of a member shall become vacant if for two consecutive months of any session of the Parliament he, without the permission of the House, fails to attend the House.

**Plain English:**
A member's seat becomes vacant if they miss House meetings for two consecutive months during any parliamentary session without the House's permission.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 39 - Quorum

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the presence of at least one-third of the whole number of the members of the House of Representatives shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the House for the exercise of its powers.

**Plain English:**
Unless Parliament makes a different rule, at least one-third of all members must be present for the House of Representatives to conduct business.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 40 - Voting in House of Representatives

**Original Text:**
> Questions arising in the House of Representatives shall be determined by a majority of votes other than that of the Speaker. The Speaker shall not vote unless the numbers are equal, and then he shall have a casting vote.

**Plain English:**
Decisions in the House of Representatives are made by majority vote. Unlike senators, the Speaker does not normally vote. The Speaker only votes if there is a tie, in which case they have a casting vote to break the tie.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.
