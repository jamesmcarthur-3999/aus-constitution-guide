# Chapter I - The Parliament

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter I of the Australian Constitution establishes the legislative branch of the Australian government, called the Parliament. This chapter is the largest in the Constitution and is divided into five parts:

1. **Part I - General** (Sections 1-6): Establishes the basic structure of Parliament and the role of the Governor-General.
2. **Part II - The Senate** (Sections 7-23): Covers the composition, powers, and procedures of the Senate.
3. **Part III - House of Representatives** (Sections 24-40): Covers the composition, powers, and procedures of the House of Representatives.
4. **Part IV - Both Houses of the Parliament** (Sections 41-50): Deals with matters common to both houses.
5. **Part V - Powers of the Parliament** (Sections 51-60): Outlines the legislative powers of Parliament.

## Part I - General (Sections 1-6)

### Section 1 - Legislative Power

**Original Text:**
> The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives, and which is hereinafter called "The Parliament," or "The Parliament of the Commonwealth."

**Plain English:**
This section establishes that the power to make laws for Australia belongs to the Federal Parliament, which consists of three parts:
1. The Queen (represented by the Governor-General)
2. The Senate
3. The House of Representatives

This three-part structure is known as a bicameral parliament (with two houses) under a constitutional monarchy.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 2 - Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty's representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in the Commonwealth during the Queen's pleasure, but subject to this Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as Her Majesty may be pleased to assign to him.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General is appointed by the Queen to be her representative in Australia. The Governor-General has the powers and functions that the Queen gives them, but must exercise these powers according to the Constitution.

**Key Cases:**
- **FAI Insurances Ltd v Winneke (1982)**: Clarified that the Governor-General (and state governors) must act according to procedural fairness when exercising certain powers.

### Section 3 - Salary of Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> There shall be payable to the Queen out of the Consolidated Revenue fund of the Commonwealth, for the salary of the Governor-General, an annual sum which, until the Parliament otherwise provides, shall be ten thousand pounds. The salary of a Governor-General shall not be altered during his continuance in office.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General receives a salary from the Australian government. Initially set at 10,000 pounds per year, Parliament can change this amount, but cannot change the salary of a Governor-General while they are in office.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 4 - Provisions relating to Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> The provisions of this Constitution relating to the Governor-General extend and apply to the Governor-General for the time being, or such person as the Queen may appoint to administer the Government of the Commonwealth; but no such person shall be entitled to receive any salary from the Commonwealth in respect of any other office during his administration of the Government of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The constitutional provisions about the Governor-General apply to whoever is currently in that role, or to any person the Queen appoints to temporarily administer the Australian government. However, that person cannot receive a salary for any other government office while they are acting as Governor-General.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 5 - Sessions of Parliament, prorogation and dissolution

**Original Text:**
> The Governor-General may appoint such times for holding the sessions of the Parliament as he thinks fit, and may also from time to time, by Proclamation or otherwise, prorogue the Parliament, and may in like manner dissolve the House of Representatives.
> 
> After any general election the Parliament shall be summoned to meet not later than thirty days after the day appointed for the return of the writs.
> 
> The Parliament shall be summoned to meet not later than six months after the establishment of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General decides when Parliament meets. They can:
- Call Parliament into session
- Temporarily suspend Parliament (prorogation)
- Dissolve the House of Representatives (which triggers an election)

After an election, Parliament must meet within 30 days of the election results being declared. When Australia was first established as a federation, Parliament had to meet within six months.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 6 - Yearly session of Parliament

**Original Text:**
> There shall be a session of the Parliament once at least in every year, so that twelve months shall not intervene between the last sitting of the Parliament in one session and its first sitting in the next session.

**Plain English:**
Parliament must meet at least once every year, and no more than 12 months can pass between one session and the next.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Part II - The Senate (Sections 7-23)

### Section 7 - The Senate

**Original Text:**
> The Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, directly chosen by the people of the State, voting, until the Parliament otherwise provides, as one electorate.
> 
> But until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of the State of Queensland, if that State be an Original State, may make laws dividing the State into divisions and determining the number of senators to be chosen for each division, and in the absence of such provision the State shall be one electorate.
> 
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides there shall be six senators for each Original State. The Parliament may make laws increasing or diminishing the number of senators for each State, but so that equal representation of the several Original States shall be maintained and that no Original State shall have less than six senators.
> 
> The senators shall be chosen for a term of six years, and the names of the senators chosen for each State shall be certified by the Governor to the Governor-General.

**Plain English:**
The Senate includes senators from each state who are directly elected by the people of that state. Each state votes as one electorate (though Queensland initially had a special provision allowing it to be divided into multiple electorates). 

Originally, each state had six senators. Parliament can change this number, but must ensure:
- Each original state has the same number of senators
- No original state has fewer than six senators

Senators are elected for six-year terms.

**Key Cases:**
- **Western Australia v Commonwealth (1975)** ("Territories Representation Case"): The High Court upheld the validity of legislation providing for senators to represent territories (under section 122), even though this resulted in unequal representation across states and territories.

### Section 8 - Qualification of electors

**Original Text:**
> The qualification of electors of senators shall be in each State that which is prescribed by this Constitution, or by the Parliament, as the qualification for electors of members of the House of Representatives; but in the choosing of senators each elector shall vote only once.

**Plain English:**
The qualifications for people to vote for senators are the same as those for voting for members of the House of Representatives. Each voter can only vote once in a Senate election.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.
