# Covering Clauses of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act

## Plain English Explanation

The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, passed by the British Parliament in 1900, contains nine introductory clauses before the main Constitution itself (which starts at Clause 9). These are sometimes called the "covering clauses" and provide important context for the Constitution.

### Clause 1 - Short Title

**Original Text:**
> This Act may be cited as The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act.

**Plain English:**
This law is officially called "The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act." This is the formal name of the Act passed by the British Parliament that established Australia as a federation.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this clause.

### Clause 2 - Act to extend to the Queen's successors

**Original Text:**
> The provisions of this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to Her Majesty's heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom.

**Plain English:**
Whenever the Constitution mentions "the Queen," it also applies to whoever succeeds her as the British monarch. This ensures the Constitution remains valid when a new monarch takes the throne.

**Key Cases:**
- **Sue v Hill (1999)**: Although not directly about this clause, the High Court found that references to "the Queen" in the Constitution now refer to the Queen in her capacity as Queen of Australia, not as Queen of the United Kingdom.

### Clause 3 - Proclamation of Commonwealth

**Original Text:**
> It shall be lawful for the Queen, with the advice of the Privy Council, to declare by proclamation that, on and after a day therein appointed, not being later than one year after the passing of this Act, the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, and Tasmania, and also, if Her Majesty is satisfied that the people of Western Australia have agreed thereto, of Western Australia, shall be united in a Federal Commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of Australia. But the Queen may, at any time after the proclamation, appoint a Governor-General for the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The Queen, advised by the Privy Council (a formal body of advisers in the UK), can officially announce the creation of the Commonwealth of Australia through a proclamation (official announcement). This proclamation would unite the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia (if the people of Western Australia agreed) into a single federation. The Queen can appoint a Governor-General for Australia at any time after making this proclamation.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this clause.

### Clause 4 - Commencement of Act

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall be established, and the Constitution of the Commonwealth shall take effect, on and after the day so appointed. But the Parliaments of the several colonies may at any time after the passing of this Act make any such laws, to come into operation on the day so appointed, as they might have made if the Constitution had taken effect at the passing of this Act.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth of Australia would officially begin, and its Constitution would become effective, on the date specified in the Queen's proclamation. However, even before that date, the parliaments of the individual colonies could pass laws that would take effect when the Commonwealth was established, as long as those laws were within their powers.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this clause.

### Clause 5 - Operation of the Constitution and laws

**Original Text:**
> This Act, and all laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under the Constitution, shall be binding on the courts, judges, and people of every State and of every part of the Commonwealth, notwithstanding anything in the laws of any State; and the laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force on all British ships, the Queen's ships of war excepted, whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The Constitution and all laws passed by the Commonwealth Parliament under the Constitution are binding on all courts, judges, and people throughout Australia, regardless of any conflicting state laws. Commonwealth laws also apply on all British ships (except naval vessels) traveling between Australian ports.

**Key Cases:**
- **Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (1920)** ("Engineers' Case"): While not directly about this clause, this case established the principle that Commonwealth laws validly made under the Constitution take precedence over state laws to the extent of any inconsistency.

### Clause 6 - Definitions

**Original Text:**
> "The Commonwealth" shall mean the Commonwealth of Australia as established under this Act.
> "The States" shall mean such of the colonies of New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia, including the northern territory of South Australia, as for the time being are parts of the Commonwealth, and such colonies or territories as may be admitted into or established by the Commonwealth as States; and each of such parts of the Commonwealth shall be called "a State".
> "Original States" shall mean such States as are parts of the Commonwealth at its establishment.

**Plain English:**
This clause defines key terms:
- "The Commonwealth" means the Commonwealth of Australia created by this Act.
- "The States" refers to the colonies of New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, Western Australia, and South Australia (including its northern territory) that become part of the Commonwealth, as well as any other colonies or territories that later join as states.
- "Original States" means the states that were part of the Commonwealth when it was first established.

**Note:** Although New Zealand was included in the definition of possible states, it never joined the Commonwealth of Australia.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this clause.

### Clause 7 - Repeal of Federal Council Act

**Original Text:**
> The Federal Council of Australasia Act, 1885, is hereby repealed, but so as not to affect any laws passed by the Federal Council of Australasia and in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth.
> Any such law may be repealed as to any State by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, or as to any colony not being a State by the Parliament thereof.

**Plain English:**
This clause cancels the Federal Council of Australasia Act of 1885, which had established a limited form of cooperation between the Australian colonies. However, any laws passed by that Federal Council remain in effect. These laws can be repealed for any state by the Commonwealth Parliament, or for any colony that isn't a state by that colony's parliament.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this clause.

### Clause 8 - Application of Colonial Boundaries Act

**Original Text:**
> After the passing of this Act the Colonial Boundaries Act, 1895, shall not apply to any colony which becomes a State of the Commonwealth; but the Commonwealth shall be taken to be a self-governing colony for the purposes of that Act.

**Plain English:**
After this Act is passed, the Colonial Boundaries Act of 1895 (a British law about changing colonial boundaries) no longer applies to any colony that becomes an Australian state. However, the Commonwealth of Australia as a whole is considered a self-governing colony for the purposes of that Act.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this clause.

### Clause 9 - Constitution

**Original Text:**
> The Constitution of the Commonwealth shall be as follows...

**Plain English:**
This clause introduces the Constitution itself, which follows in the document. The Constitution proper begins at this point and consists of eight chapters and 128 sections.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this clause, though countless cases interpret the Constitution that follows it.
