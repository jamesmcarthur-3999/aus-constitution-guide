# Chapter III - The Judicature

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter III of the Australian Constitution establishes the judicial branch of the Australian government, including the High Court of Australia and other federal courts. This chapter covers sections 71-80 and is particularly important for the separation of powers in Australia.

### Section 71 - Judicial power and Courts

**Original Text:**
> The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court of Australia, and in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction. The High Court shall consist of a Chief Justice, and so many other Justices, not less than two, as the Parliament prescribes.

**Plain English:**
The power to interpret and apply laws in Australia belongs to:
- The High Court of Australia (the highest court in the country)
- Other federal courts created by Parliament
- State courts that Parliament gives federal powers to

The High Court must have a Chief Justice and at least two other Justices. Parliament can decide exactly how many Justices there should be.

**Key Cases:**
- **Re Judiciary and Navigation Acts (1921)**: The High Court held that Commonwealth legislation cannot confer non-judicial power on federal courts, nor can it confer judicial power on bodies that are not courts.
- **Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally (1999)**: The High Court ruled that state parliaments cannot confer state jurisdiction on federal courts.

### Section 72 - Judges' appointment, tenure and remuneration

**Original Text:**
> The Justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament:
> 
> (i) shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council;
> 
> (ii) shall not be removed except by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity;
> 
> (iii) shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; but the remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.

**Plain English:**
Judges of the High Court and other federal courts:
- Are appointed by the Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council
- Can only be removed if both houses of Parliament agree that there has been proven misbehavior or incapacity, and the Governor-General (acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council) removes them
- Receive a salary set by Parliament, which cannot be reduced while they are in office

**Note:** Following a 1977 referendum, this section was altered to include a retirement age of 70 for federal judges, though this is not shown in the original text above.

**Key Cases:**
- **Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia v JW Alexander Ltd (1918)**: The High Court ruled that federal courts exercising judicial power under Chapter III must be composed of judges with the tenure and salary protections provided in section 72.

### Section 73 - Appellate jurisdiction of High Court

**Original Text:**
> The High Court shall have jurisdiction, with such exceptions and subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes, to hear and determine appeals from all judgments, decrees, orders, and sentences:
> 
> (i) of any Justice or Justices exercising the original jurisdiction of the High Court;
> 
> (ii) of any other federal court, or court exercising federal jurisdiction; or of the Supreme Court of any State, or of any other court of any State from which at the establishment of the Commonwealth an appeal lies to the Queen in Council;
> 
> (iii) of the Inter-State Commission, but as to questions of law only;
> 
> and the judgment of the High Court in all such cases shall be final and conclusive.
> 
> But no exception or regulation prescribed by the Parliament shall prevent the High Court from hearing and determining any appeal from the Supreme Court of a State in any matter in which at the establishment of the Commonwealth an appeal lies from such Supreme Court to the Queen in Council.
> 
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the conditions of and restrictions on appeals to the Queen in Council from the Supreme Courts of the several States shall be applicable to appeals from them to the High Court.

**Plain English:**
The High Court can hear appeals from:
- Decisions made by individual High Court justices in their original jurisdiction
- Decisions of other federal courts or courts exercising federal jurisdiction
- Decisions of state Supreme Courts or other state courts that could appeal to the Privy Council when the Commonwealth was established
- Decisions of the Inter-State Commission, but only on legal questions (not factual ones)

The High Court's decisions on these appeals are final. Parliament can make rules about these appeals but cannot prevent the High Court from hearing appeals from state Supreme Courts in matters where an appeal to the Privy Council was possible when the Commonwealth was established. Until Parliament makes its own rules, the same conditions that apply to appeals to the Privy Council will apply to appeals to the High Court.

**Key Cases:**
- **Parker v The Queen (1963)**: The High Court asserted its independence from decisions of the House of Lords (UK's highest court at the time), establishing that while English precedents were persuasive, they were not binding on the High Court.

### Section 74 - Appeal to Queen in Council

**Original Text:**
> No appeal shall be permitted to the Queen in Council from a decision of the High Court upon any question, howsoever arising, as to the limits inter se of the Constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States, or as to the limits inter se of the Constitutional powers of any two or more States, unless the High Court shall certify that the question is one which ought to be determined by Her Majesty in Council.
> 
> The High Court may so certify if satisfied that for any special reason the certificate should be granted, and thereupon an appeal shall lie to Her Majesty in Council on the question without further leave.
> 
> Except as provided in this section, this Constitution shall not impair any right which the Queen may be pleased to exercise by virtue of Her Royal prerogative to grant special leave of appeal from the High Court to Her Majesty in Council. The Parliament may make laws limiting the matters in which such leave may be asked, but proposed laws containing any such limitation shall be reserved by the Governor-General for Her Majesty's pleasure.

**Plain English:**
Appeals from the High Court to the Privy Council in London about the boundaries between Commonwealth and state constitutional powers, or between the constitutional powers of different states, are only allowed if the High Court certifies that the question should be determined by the Privy Council. The High Court can grant this certificate if there is a special reason to do so.

Apart from these cases, the Constitution does not affect the Queen's right to grant special leave to appeal from the High Court to the Privy Council. Parliament can make laws limiting the matters in which such appeals can be sought, but these laws need the Queen's approval.

**Note:** Since the Australia Acts 1986, appeals to the Privy Council are no longer possible from any Australian court.

**Key Cases:**
- **Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (No 2) (1985)**: The High Court declared it would never again grant a certificate allowing an appeal to the Privy Council.

### Section 75 - Original jurisdiction of High Court

**Original Text:**
> In all matters:
> 
> (i) arising under any treaty;
> 
> (ii) affecting consuls or other representatives of other countries;
> 
> (iii) in which the Commonwealth, or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth, is a party;
> 
> (iv) between States, or between residents of different States, or between a State and a resident of another State;
> 
> (v) in which a writ of Mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth;
> 
> the High Court shall have original jurisdiction.

**Plain English:**
The High Court has original jurisdiction (meaning cases can be started directly in the High Court) in the following matters:
- Cases involving international treaties
- Cases affecting foreign consuls or representatives
- Cases where the Commonwealth is a party
- Cases between states, between residents of different states, or between a state and a resident of another state
- Cases where someone is seeking a court order (mandamus, prohibition, or injunction) against a Commonwealth officer

**Key Cases:**
- **Plaintiff S157/2002 v Commonwealth (2003)**: The High Court held that section 75(v) ensures that actions by Commonwealth officers can always be reviewed by the High Court, even if legislation attempts to exclude judicial review. This provision is a fundamental protection of the rule of law.

### Section 76 - Additional original jurisdiction

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter:
> 
> (i) arising under this Constitution, or involving its interpretation;
> 
> (ii) arising under any laws made by the Parliament;
> 
> (iii) of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;
> 
> (iv) relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different States.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can make laws giving the High Court original jurisdiction (the ability to hear cases directly) in these additional matters:
- Cases arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation
- Cases arising under laws made by Parliament
- Cases involving admiralty and maritime jurisdiction (shipping and naval matters)
- Cases about the same subject matter where claims are made under the laws of different states

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section, though the jurisdiction has been conferred by the Judiciary Act 1903.

### Section 77 - Power to define jurisdiction

**Original Text:**
> With respect to any of the matters mentioned in the last two sections the Parliament may make laws:
> 
> (i) defining the jurisdiction of any federal court other than the High Court;
> 
> (ii) defining the extent to which the jurisdiction of any federal court shall be exclusive of that which belongs to or is invested in the courts of the States;
> 
> (iii) investing any court of a State with federal jurisdiction.

**Plain English:**
For the matters mentioned in sections 75 and 76, Parliament can make laws:
- Defining the jurisdiction of federal courts (other than the High Court)
- Determining which matters only federal courts can handle (to the exclusion of state courts)
- Giving state courts the power to handle federal matters

**Key Cases:**
- **MZXOT v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2008)**: The High Court confirmed Parliament's power to invest state courts with federal jurisdiction, and to define the extent to which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

### Section 78 - Proceedings against Commonwealth or State

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may make laws conferring rights to proceed against the Commonwealth or a State in respect of matters within the limits of the judicial power.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can make laws allowing people to sue the Commonwealth or a state in matters that fall within the scope of federal judicial power.

**Key Cases:**
- **Commonwealth v Mewett (1997)**: The High Court considered the scope of Parliament's power to confer rights to proceed against the Commonwealth.

### Section 79 - Number of judges

**Original Text:**
> The federal jurisdiction of any court may be exercised by such number of judges as the Parliament prescribes.

**Plain English:**
Parliament can decide how many judges are needed when a court is exercising federal jurisdiction.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 80 - Trial by jury

**Original Text:**
> The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or places as the Parliament prescribes.

**Plain English:**
When someone is charged with a serious offense (on indictment) against a Commonwealth law, they must be tried by a jury. The trial must take place in the state where the offense was committed. If the offense wasn't committed in any state, Parliament can decide where the trial should be held.

**Key Cases:**
- **Kingswell v The Queen (1985)**: The High Court held that Section 80 applies only to trials "on indictment," and Parliament can decide which offenses are to be tried on indictment. This limits the protection offered by this section.
- **Cheatle v The Queen (1993)**: The High Court held that the term "jury" in section 80 refers to a body of 12 persons who must reach a unanimous verdict.
