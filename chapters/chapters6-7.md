# Chapter VI - New States

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter VI of the Australian Constitution deals with the admission or establishment of new states and territories. This chapter covers sections 121-124 and provides mechanisms for expanding the federation beyond the original six states.

### Section 121 - New States may be admitted or established

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may admit to the Commonwealth or establish new States, and may upon such admission or establishment make or impose such terms and conditions, including the extent of representation in either House of the Parliament, as it thinks fit.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth Parliament can:
- Admit new states to the Commonwealth
- Establish new states
- Set whatever terms and conditions it thinks appropriate for new states, including how many representatives they get in Parliament

**Note:** No new states have been admitted or established since federation, though the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory have been granted self-government and limited representation in Parliament.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 122 - Government of territories

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of and accepted by the Commonwealth, or otherwise acquired by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the terms which it thinks fit.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth Parliament can make laws for the government of territories that:
- Are surrendered by a state and accepted by the Commonwealth
- Are placed under Commonwealth authority by the Queen (now King) and accepted by the Commonwealth
- Are acquired by the Commonwealth in some other way

Parliament can also allow territories to be represented in either house of Parliament, to whatever extent and on whatever terms Parliament decides.

**Key Cases:**
- **Western Australia v Commonwealth (1975)** ("Territories Representation Case"): The High Court upheld legislation allowing the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to be represented in the Senate, despite each territory having fewer senators than states.
- **Berwick Ltd v Gray (1976)**: The High Court confirmed the Commonwealth's power to make laws for territories surrendered by states.

### Section 123 - Alteration of limits of States

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament of the Commonwealth may, with the consent of the Parliament of a State, and the approval of the majority of the electors of the State voting upon the question, increase, diminish, or otherwise alter the limits of the State, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed on, and may, with the like consent, make provision respecting the effect and operation of any increase or diminution or alteration of territory in relation to any State affected.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth Parliament can change a state's boundaries (increase, decrease, or otherwise alter them), but only if:
- The state parliament agrees
- A majority of voters in the state approve in a referendum

The Commonwealth can also make rules about how these changes affect the state, but again only with the state's consent.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 124 - Formation of new States

**Original Text:**
> A new State may be formed by separation of territory from a State, but only with the consent of the Parliament thereof, and a new State may be formed by the union of two or more States or parts of States, but only with the consent of the Parliaments of the States affected.

**Plain English:**
A new state can be created in two ways:
1. By separating territory from an existing state, but only if that state's parliament agrees
2. By joining together two or more states (or parts of states), but only if all the affected state parliaments agree

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

# Chapter VII - Miscellaneous

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter VII of the Australian Constitution covers miscellaneous provisions that don't fit neatly into the other chapters. This chapter originally contained sections 125-127, but section 127 was repealed following the 1967 referendum.

### Section 125 - Seat of Government

**Original Text:**
> The seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth, and shall be in the State of New South Wales, and be distant not less than one hundred miles from Sydney.
> 
> Such territory shall contain an area of not less than one hundred square miles, and such portion thereof as shall consist of Crown lands shall be granted to the Commonwealth without any payment therefor.
> 
> The Parliament shall sit at Melbourne until it meets at the seat of Government.

**Plain English:**
The national capital (the seat of the Commonwealth government) is to be:
- Determined by Parliament
- Located on Commonwealth territory
- In New South Wales
- At least 100 miles (about 161 km) from Sydney
- At least 100 square miles (about 259 square km) in area

Any Crown land within this territory is to be granted to the Commonwealth for free. Until Parliament meets in the new capital, it will sit in Melbourne.

**Note:** This section led to the establishment of the Australian Capital Territory and the building of Canberra as the national capital. The Commonwealth Parliament moved from Melbourne to Canberra in 1927.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 126 - Power to Her Majesty to authorise Governor-General to appoint deputies

**Original Text:**
> The Queen may authorise the Governor-General to appoint any person, or any persons jointly or severally, to be his deputy or deputies within any part of the Commonwealth, and in that capacity to exercise during the pleasure of the Governor-General such powers and functions of the Governor-General as he thinks fit to assign to such deputy or deputies, subject to any limitations expressed or directions given by the Queen; but the appointment of such deputy or deputies shall not affect the exercise by the Governor-General himself of any power or function.

**Plain English:**
The Queen (now King) can authorize the Governor-General to appoint one or more deputies to act on their behalf in any part of Australia. These deputies can exercise whatever powers and functions the Governor-General assigns to them, subject to any limitations or directions from the Queen/King. The appointment of deputies does not prevent the Governor-General from continuing to exercise their own powers and functions.

**Note:** In practice, the Governor-General appoints Administrators to act as their deputy in each state and territory, typically the state governors and territory administrators.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### [Section 127 - Repealed]

**Original Text:**
> In reckoning the numbers of the people of the Commonwealth, or of a State or other part of the Commonwealth, aboriginal natives shall not be counted.

**Plain English:**
This section was repealed by the 1967 referendum. It had excluded Aboriginal people from being counted in the population of Australia or any state or territory.

**Note:** The repeal of this section meant that Aboriginal people would be included in population counts, which are used for various purposes including determining the number of members each state is entitled to in the House of Representatives.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section before its repeal.
