# Chapter V - The States

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter V of the Australian Constitution deals with the states, their powers, and their relationship with the Commonwealth. This chapter includes Sections 106-120.

### Section 106 - Saving of Constitutions

**Original Text:**
> The Constitution of each State of the Commonwealth shall, subject to this Constitution, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission or establishment of the State, as the case may be, until altered in accordance with the Constitution of the State.

**Plain English:**
Each State's Constitution continues to operate as it was when the Commonwealth was established or when the State joined the Commonwealth. State Constitutions remain in force, but are subject to the Commonwealth Constitution. State Constitutions can only be changed according to their own rules for amendment.

This section recognizes the continuing constitutional existence of the States within the federal system.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 107 - Saving of Power of State Parliaments

**Original Text:**
> Every power of the Parliament of a Colony which has become or becomes a State, shall, unless it is by this Constitution exclusively vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth or withdrawn from the Parliament of the State, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission or establishment of the State, as the case may be.

**Plain English:**
State Parliaments keep all the powers they had as colonies, except for powers that the Constitution:
1. Gives exclusively to the Commonwealth Parliament; or
2. Takes away from State Parliaments

This section confirms that States retain significant legislative powers in the federal system.

**Key Cases:**
- **Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (1920)** ("Engineers' Case"): Rejected the doctrine of "reserved State powers" and established that State powers should be interpreted according to the Constitution's text, not by assumptions about what powers were meant to be reserved to the States.

### Section 108 - Saving of State laws

**Original Text:**
> Every law in force in a Colony which has become or becomes a State, and relating to any matter within the powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, shall, subject to this Constitution, continue in force in the State; and, until provision is made in that behalf by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, the Parliament of the State shall have such powers of alteration and of repeal in respect of any such law as the Parliament of the Colony had until the Colony became a State.

**Plain English:**
Colony laws that were in force when a colony became a State continue to be valid, even if they relate to matters that the Commonwealth Parliament now has power over. State Parliaments continue to have the power to change or repeal these laws until the Commonwealth Parliament makes its own laws about those matters.

This section allowed for a smooth transition to federation by maintaining existing laws until they were replaced.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 109 - Inconsistency of laws

**Original Text:**
> When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid.

**Plain English:**
When a State law conflicts with a Commonwealth law, the Commonwealth law prevails. The State law is invalid to the extent that it is inconsistent with the Commonwealth law.

This section establishes the principle of Commonwealth supremacy in cases of conflict with State laws.

**Key Cases:**
- **Victoria v Commonwealth (1937)** ("Pharmaceutical Benefits Case"): Clarified that Section 109 operates when Commonwealth and State laws cannot both be obeyed at the same time, or when a Commonwealth law intends to cover a field completely to the exclusion of State laws.
- **Clyde Engineering Co Ltd v Cowburn (1926)**: Established the "covering the field" test of inconsistency.

### Section 110 - Provisions referring to Governor

**Original Text:**
> The provisions of this Constitution relating to the Governor of a State extend and apply to the Governor for the time being of the State, or other chief executive officer or administrator of the government of the State.

**Plain English:**
Any mention in the Constitution of a State Governor also applies to whoever is acting as Governor at the time, or to any other chief executive officer or administrator of the State government.

This section ensures that constitutional provisions about State Governors apply to acting Governors and other officials who might temporarily perform the Governor's role.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 111 - States may surrender territory

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament of a State may surrender any part of the State to the Commonwealth; and upon such surrender, and the acceptance thereof by the Commonwealth, such part of the State shall become subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
A State Parliament can give up (surrender) any part of the State to the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth accepts this territory, it comes under the exclusive control of the Commonwealth.

This section allows for the transfer of territory from States to the Commonwealth, as occurred with the Australian Capital Territory (surrendered by New South Wales) and the Northern Territory (transferred from South Australia).

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 112 - States may levy charges for inspection laws

**Original Text:**
> After uniform duties of customs have been imposed, a State may levy on imports or exports, or on goods passing into or out of the State, such charges as may be necessary for executing the inspection laws of the State; but the net produce of all charges so levied shall be for the use of the Commonwealth; and any such inspection laws may be annulled by the Parliament of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
After uniform customs duties were imposed, a State can still charge fees on imports, exports, or goods moving into or out of the State, but only if these charges are necessary to implement the State's inspection laws (laws that ensure products meet certain standards). All net revenue from these charges goes to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Parliament can overturn any such State inspection laws.

This section allows States to maintain quality control and safety standards for goods, while ensuring they cannot use inspection laws as a disguised form of customs duty.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 113 - Intoxicating liquids

**Original Text:**
> All fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquids passing into any State or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale, or storage, shall be subject to the laws of the State as if such liquids had been produced in the State.

**Plain English:**
Alcoholic beverages that enter a State or remain in a State for use, consumption, sale, or storage are subject to that State's laws as if they had been produced in that State.

This section allows States to regulate alcohol within their borders, regardless of where the alcohol was produced.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 114 - States may not raise forces. Taxation of property of Commonwealth or State

**Original Text:**
> A State shall not, without the consent of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, raise or maintain any naval or military force, or impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to the Commonwealth, nor shall the Commonwealth impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a State.

**Plain English:**
States cannot raise or maintain military forces without Commonwealth Parliament consent. States cannot tax Commonwealth property, and the Commonwealth cannot tax State property.

This section ensures the Commonwealth has primary responsibility for defense and establishes mutual immunity from property taxation between the Commonwealth and States.

**Key Cases:**
- **Melbourne Corporation v Commonwealth (1947)**: While not directly about Section 114, this case established limits on Commonwealth power to discriminate against States or impair their functioning, complementing the tax immunity in Section 114.

### Section 115 - States not to coin money

**Original Text:**
> A State shall not coin money, nor make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts.

**Plain English:**
States cannot create their own currency. They cannot make anything except gold and silver coins legal tender (currency that must be accepted for payment of debts).

This section gives the Commonwealth exclusive control over currency, an important aspect of economic sovereignty.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 116 - Commonwealth not to legislate in respect of religion

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth cannot make laws that:
1. Establish an official religion
2. Force people to observe religious practices
3. Prohibit people from practicing their religion
4. Require religious tests for Commonwealth public offices or positions of trust

This section protects religious freedom from Commonwealth interference, but does not apply to the States.

**Key Cases:**
- **Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses Inc v Commonwealth (1943)**: The High Court upheld Commonwealth wartime legislation that dissolved the Jehovah's Witnesses organization, finding it did not prohibit the free exercise of religion.
- **Attorney-General (Vic); Ex rel Black v Commonwealth (1981)** ("DOGS Case"): The High Court held that Commonwealth funding for religious schools did not violate the prohibition on "establishing any religion."

### Section 117 - Rights of residents in States

**Original Text:**
> A subject of the Queen, resident in any State, shall not be subject in any other State to any disability or discrimination which would not be equally applicable to him if he were a subject of the Queen resident in such other State.

**Plain English:**
A person who lives in one State cannot be subjected to disabilities or discrimination in another State that would not apply to residents of that other State.

This section prohibits States from discriminating against residents of other States.

**Key Cases:**
- **Street v Queensland Bar Association (1989)**: The High Court struck down a Queensland law requiring lawyers from other States to live in Queensland or maintain a principal office there in order to practice law in Queensland.

### Section 118 - Recognition of laws, etc. of States

**Original Text:**
> Full faith and credit shall be given, throughout the Commonwealth, to the laws, the public Acts and records, and the judicial proceedings of every State.

**Plain English:**
Throughout Australia, full recognition must be given to the laws, public acts, records, and court judgments of every State.

This section ensures that legal actions and decisions in one State are recognized and respected in other States.

**Key Cases:**
- **Breavington v Godleman (1988)**: The High Court considered how Section 118 affects which State's law should apply in a case with connections to multiple States.

### Section 119 - Protection of States from invasion and violence

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth must protect States from invasion. It must also protect States from domestic violence (internal unrest or rebellion) if the State Government requests help.

This section establishes the Commonwealth's responsibility to defend States from external threats and to assist with internal security when requested.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 120 - Custody of offenders against laws of the Commonwealth

**Original Text:**
> Every State shall make provision for the detention in its prisons of persons accused or convicted of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, and for the punishment of persons convicted of such offences, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws to give effect to this provision.

**Plain English:**
States must detain people accused or convicted of breaking Commonwealth laws in their prisons, and must punish people convicted of Commonwealth offenses. The Commonwealth Parliament can make laws to implement this provision.

This section establishes that States are responsible for housing Commonwealth prisoners, reflecting the practical reality that the Commonwealth does not maintain its own prison system (with limited exceptions).

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.
