# Chapter V - The States

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter V of the Australian Constitution deals with the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states, and ensures that the states continue to exist as self-governing entities within the federation. This chapter covers sections 106-120 and addresses issues such as the powers of state governments, the relationship between state and Commonwealth laws, and the rights of state residents.

### Section 106 - Saving of Constitutions

**Original Text:**
> The Constitution of each State of the Commonwealth shall, subject to this Constitution, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission or establishment of the State, as the case may be, until altered in accordance with the Constitution of the State.

**Plain English:**
Each state's constitution continues in force after federation, subject to the Commonwealth Constitution. State constitutions can only be changed according to their own rules for amendment.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 107 - Saving of Power of State Parliaments

**Original Text:**
> Every power of the Parliament of a Colony which has become or becomes a State, shall, unless it is by this Constitution exclusively vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth or withdrawn from the Parliament of the State, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission or establishment of the State, as the case may be.

**Plain English:**
State parliaments keep all the powers they had as colonies, except for powers that the Constitution:
- Gives exclusively to the Commonwealth Parliament, or
- Takes away from the state parliaments

**Key Cases:**
- **Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (1920)** ("Engineers' Case"): The High Court rejected the "reserved powers" doctrine, which had held that the Constitution should be interpreted to preserve state powers. Instead, the Court held that Commonwealth powers should be interpreted according to their natural meaning, even if this diminishes state powers.

### Section 108 - Saving of State laws

**Original Text:**
> Every law in force in a Colony which has become or becomes a State, and relating to any matter within the powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, shall, subject to this Constitution, continue in force in the State; and, until provision is made in that behalf by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, the Parliament of the State shall have such powers of alteration and of repeal in respect of any such law as the Parliament of the Colony had before the Colony became a State.

**Plain English:**
Colonial laws that were in force when a colony became a state continue in force after federation, even if they relate to matters now within Commonwealth power. Until the Commonwealth Parliament makes laws on these matters, state parliaments can amend or repeal these laws just as they could before federation.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 109 - Inconsistency of laws

**Original Text:**
> When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid.

**Plain English:**
When a state law conflicts with a Commonwealth law, the Commonwealth law takes precedence. The state law is invalid to the extent of the inconsistency.

**Key Cases:**
- **Victoria v Commonwealth (1937)** ("Pharmaceutical Benefits Case"): The High Court established two tests for inconsistency:
  1. Direct inconsistency: Where it is impossible to obey both laws
  2. Indirect inconsistency: Where a Commonwealth law intends to be a complete statement of the law on a subject
- **Dickson v The Queen (2010)**: The High Court confirmed that section 109 does not apply to territories, only to states.

### Section 110 - Provisions referring to Governor

**Original Text:**
> The provisions of this Constitution relating to the Governor of a State extend and apply to the Governor for the time being of the State, or other chief executive officer or administrator of the government of the State.

**Plain English:**
Whenever the Constitution refers to a state Governor, this also applies to:
- Whoever is currently serving as Governor
- Any other chief executive officer
- Any administrator of the state government

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 111 - States may surrender territory

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament of a State may surrender any part of the State to the Commonwealth; and upon such surrender, and the acceptance thereof by the Commonwealth, such part of the State shall become subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
A state parliament can give up part of its territory to the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth accepts, it gains exclusive jurisdiction over that area.

**Key Cases:**
- **Berwick Ltd v Gray (1976)**: This case involved the surrender of land by New South Wales to the Commonwealth for the establishment of the Australian Capital Territory.

### Section 112 - States may levy charges for inspection laws

**Original Text:**
> After uniform duties of customs have been imposed, a State may levy on imports or exports, or on goods passing into or out of the State, such charges as may be necessary for executing the inspection laws of the State; but the net produce of all charges so levied shall be for the use of the Commonwealth; and any such inspection laws may be annulled by the Parliament of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
After uniform customs duties were imposed, states can charge fees on imports, exports, or goods moving into or out of the state, but only to cover the cost of inspection laws. The net revenue from these charges goes to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Parliament can invalidate any state inspection laws.

**Key Cases:**
- **North Eastern Dairy Co Ltd v Dairy Industry Authority of NSW (1975)**: The High Court considered the validity of state inspection schemes and charges under this section.

### Section 113 - Intoxicating liquids

**Original Text:**
> All fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquids passing into any State or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale, or storage, shall be subject to the laws of the State as if such liquids had been produced in the State.

**Plain English:**
Alcoholic drinks that enter a state, or remain in a state for use, consumption, sale, or storage, are subject to that state's laws as if they had been produced in that state.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 114 - States may not raise forces. Taxation of property of Commonwealth or State

**Original Text:**
> A State shall not, without the consent of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, raise or maintain any naval or military force, or impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to the Commonwealth, nor shall the Commonwealth impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a State.

**Plain English:**
Without Commonwealth Parliament's consent, states cannot:
- Raise or maintain a naval or military force
- Tax any Commonwealth property

Similarly, the Commonwealth cannot tax any state property.

**Key Cases:**
- **Victoria v Commonwealth (1971)** ("Payroll Tax Case"): The High Court held that a Commonwealth payroll tax imposed on state employees was valid because it was a tax on the employment relationship, not on state property.
- **Queensland v Commonwealth (1987)**: The High Court found that land occupied by the Australian Telecommunications Commission was "property" of the Commonwealth and immune from state land tax.

### Section 115 - States not to coin money

**Original Text:**
> A State shall not coin money, nor make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts.

**Plain English:**
States cannot:
- Mint their own coins
- Make anything except gold and silver coins legal tender for paying debts

**Note:** This section is now effectively superseded by Commonwealth legislation, as the Commonwealth has exclusive power over currency.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 116 - Commonwealth not to legislate in respect of religion

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth cannot make laws:
- Establishing an official or state religion
- Forcing people to observe religious practices
- Prohibiting the free practice of religion

Additionally, a person's religion cannot be used as a test for holding any Commonwealth office or position of public trust.

**Key Cases:**
- **Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses Inc v Commonwealth (1943)**: The High Court upheld wartime regulations that restricted the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses, finding that section 116 doesn't protect religious activities that are a threat to national security.
- **Attorney-General (Vic); Ex Rel Black v Commonwealth (1981)** ("DOGS Case"): The High Court held that Commonwealth funding of religious schools did not violate section 116, as it did not amount to "establishing" a religion.

### Section 117 - Rights of residents in States

**Original Text:**
> A subject of the Queen, resident in any State, shall not be subject in any other State to any disability or discrimination which would not be equally applicable to him if he were a subject of the Queen resident in such other State.

**Plain English:**
A person living in one state cannot be treated differently in another state just because they are not a resident of that other state. They must be treated the same as residents of the state they are visiting.

**Key Cases:**
- **Street v Queensland Bar Association (1989)**: The High Court invalidated a Queensland requirement that barristers live in Queensland, finding it discriminated against residents of other states.
- **Sweedman v Transport Accident Commission (2006)**: The High Court found that section 117 only prohibits discrimination against non-residents that wouldn't apply to residents. It doesn't prohibit laws that treat people differently based on where an event occurred.

### Section 118 - Recognition of laws &c. of States

**Original Text:**
> Full faith and credit shall be given, throughout the Commonwealth to the laws, the public Acts and records, and the judicial proceedings of every State.

**Plain English:**
Throughout Australia, all states must recognize and respect the laws, public acts, records, and court decisions of every other state.

**Key Cases:**
- **Breavington v Godleman (1988)**: The High Court considered the application of section 118 to cases where a car accident occurred in one state but legal proceedings were initiated in another state.
- **John Pfeiffer Pty Ltd v Rogerson (2000)**: The High Court held that in tort cases, the substantive law to be applied is the law of the place where the tort occurred, which gives effect to section 118.

### Section 119 - Protection of States from invasion and violence

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth must:
- Protect every state against invasion from outside Australia
- Protect a state against internal violence or rebellion, but only if the state government requests this assistance

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 120 - Custody of offenders against laws of the Commonwealth

**Original Text:**
> Every State shall make provision for the detention in its prisons of persons accused or convicted of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, and for the punishment of persons convicted of such offences, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws to give effect to this provision.

**Plain English:**
States must allow people who are accused or convicted of breaking Commonwealth laws to be held in state prisons. States must also provide for the punishment of people convicted of Commonwealth offenses. The Commonwealth Parliament can make laws to implement this provision.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.
