# Chapter V - The States

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter V of the Australian Constitution, covering sections 106-120, defines the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states. It addresses the constitutional status of the states, their powers, and limitations, as well as the interaction between Commonwealth and state laws.

## Section 106 - Saving of Constitutions

**Original Text:**
> The Constitution of each State of the Commonwealth shall, subject to this Constitution, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission or establishment of the State, as the case may be, until altered in accordance with the Constitution of the State.

**Plain English:**
Each state's constitution continues to operate after federation, subject to the Commonwealth Constitution. State constitutions can only be changed according to their own amendment procedures.

This section recognizes that the states retain their own constitutional systems within the federal structure.

**Key Cases:**
- **McCawley v The King (1920)**: Addressed the relationship between state constitutions and the Commonwealth Constitution.

## Section 107 - Saving of Power of State Parliaments

**Original Text:**
> Every power of the Parliament of a Colony which has become or becomes a State, shall, unless it is by this Constitution exclusively vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth or withdrawn from the Parliament of the State, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission or establishment of the State, as the case may be.

**Plain English:**
State parliaments keep all the powers they had as colonies, except for powers:
1. Exclusively given to the Commonwealth Parliament by the Constitution
2. Specifically taken away from the states by the Constitution

This section establishes that states retain significant legislative powers under the federal system.

**Key Cases:**
- **Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd (1920)**: Rejected earlier interpretations that had implied additional limitations on Commonwealth power to protect state powers.

## Section 108 - Saving of State laws

**Original Text:**
> Every law in force in a Colony which has become or becomes a State, and relating to any matter within the power of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, shall, subject to this Constitution, continue in force in the State; and, until provision is made in that behalf by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, the Parliament of the State shall have such powers of alteration and of repeal in respect of any such law as the Parliament of the Colony had before the Colony became a State.

**Plain English:**
Colonial laws continue in force after a colony becomes a state, even for matters within Commonwealth power. State parliaments can alter or repeal these laws until the Commonwealth Parliament makes laws about the same matters.

This section ensured legal continuity after federation by maintaining existing colonial laws.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 109 - Inconsistency of laws

**Original Text:**
> When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid.

**Plain English:**
When a state law conflicts with a Commonwealth law, the Commonwealth law prevails. The state law is invalid to the extent of the inconsistency.

This is a fundamental principle of Australia's federal system, establishing the priority of Commonwealth laws over inconsistent state laws.

**Key Cases:**
- **Ex parte McLean (1930)**: Established two tests for inconsistency - direct inconsistency (when it's impossible to obey both laws) and indirect inconsistency (when Commonwealth law intends to be a complete statement of the law on a topic).
- **Commonwealth v Tasmania (Tasmanian Dam Case) (1983)**: Applied section 109 in finding that Commonwealth environmental law prevailed over inconsistent Tasmanian legislation.

## Section 110 - Provisions referring to Governor

**Original Text:**
> The provisions of this Constitution relating to the Governor of a State extend and apply to the Governor for the time being of the State, or other chief executive officer or administrator of the government of the State.

**Plain English:**
References to a "Governor" of a state in the Constitution apply to:
1. Whoever is currently serving as Governor of the state
2. Any other chief executive officer or administrator of the state government

This section ensures that constitutional provisions apply regardless of changes to the specific title or identity of state executives.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 111 - States may surrender territory

**Original Text:**
> The Parliament of a State may surrender any part of the State to the Commonwealth; and upon such surrender, and the acceptance thereof by the Commonwealth, such part of the State shall become subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
A state parliament can surrender part of its territory to the Commonwealth. If the Commonwealth accepts this territory, it comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth.

This section provides a mechanism for transferring territory from states to the Commonwealth, which was used, for example, in establishing the Australian Capital Territory.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section, although it was applied in practice when New South Wales surrendered territory to create the Australian Capital Territory.

## Section 112 - States may levy charges for inspection laws

**Original Text:**
> After uniform duties of customs have been imposed, a State may levy on imports or exports, or on goods passing into or out of the State, such charges as may be necessary for executing the inspection laws of the State; but the net produce of all charges so levied shall be for the use of the Commonwealth; and any such inspection laws may be annulled by the Parliament of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
After uniform customs duties are imposed, a state can:
1. Charge fees on imports, exports, or goods entering or leaving the state, but only to cover the cost of inspection laws
2. The net revenue from these charges belongs to the Commonwealth
3. The Commonwealth Parliament can override any state inspection laws

This section allows states to maintain necessary inspection systems while preventing them from using inspection charges as disguised customs duties.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 113 - Intoxicating liquids

**Original Text:**
> All fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquids passing into any State or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale, or storage, shall be subject to the laws of the State as if such liquids had been produced in the State.

**Plain English:**
States can regulate alcohol (fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquids) that enters the state or remains in the state for use, consumption, sale, or storage, in the same way that they can regulate alcohol produced within the state.

This section allows states to maintain control over alcohol regulation despite section 92's guarantee of free interstate trade.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 114 - States may not raise forces. Taxation of property of Commonwealth or State

**Original Text:**
> A State shall not, without the consent of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, raise or maintain any naval or military force, or impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to the Commonwealth, nor shall the Commonwealth impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to a State.

**Plain English:**
States cannot:
1. Raise or maintain military or naval forces without Commonwealth permission
2. Tax any Commonwealth property

The Commonwealth cannot tax any state property.

This section maintains Commonwealth control over defense forces and establishes mutual immunity from property taxation between the Commonwealth and states.

**Key Cases:**
- **South Australia v Commonwealth (1962)**: Addressed the scope of the prohibition on Commonwealth taxation of state property.

## Section 115 - States not to coin money

**Original Text:**
> A State shall not coin money, nor make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts.

**Plain English:**
States cannot:
1. Mint their own coins
2. Make anything other than gold and silver coins legal tender (money that must be accepted for paying debts)

This section gives the Commonwealth exclusive control over currency, though in practice, Commonwealth legislation now determines what constitutes legal tender.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 116 - Commonwealth not to legislate in respect of religion

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth cannot make laws:
1. Establishing an official religion
2. Requiring religious observances
3. Prohibiting the free practice of any religion

The Commonwealth cannot require a religious test for any Commonwealth office or position of public trust.

This section protects religious freedom from Commonwealth interference, though it does not apply to state laws.

**Key Cases:**
- **Attorney-General (Vic); Ex rel Black v Commonwealth (1981)** (DOGS Case): Interpreted "establishing any religion" narrowly, finding that Commonwealth funding of religious schools did not violate section 116.

## Section 117 - Rights of residents in States

**Original Text:**
> A subject of the Queen, resident in any State, shall not be subject in any other State to any disability or discrimination which would not be equally applicable to him if he were a subject of the Queen resident in such other State.

**Plain English:**
A person who is an Australian citizen (formerly "subject of the Queen") and resident in one state cannot be discriminated against or disadvantaged in another state in ways that residents of that other state are not.

This section protects residents of one state from being discriminated against by another state on the basis of their state of residence.

**Key Cases:**
- **Street v Queensland Bar Association (1989)**: Found that Queensland's requirement for interstate barristers to have a local residence and give up interstate practice discriminated against interstate residents and violated section 117.

## Section 118 - Recognition of laws, &c. of States

**Original Text:**
> Full faith and credit shall be given, throughout the Commonwealth, to the laws, the public Acts and records, and the judicial proceedings of every State.

**Plain English:**
Throughout Australia, each state must recognize the laws, public acts, records, and court decisions of every other state.

This section ensures that legal processes, documents, and judgments from one state are respected and recognized in other states.

**Key Cases:**
- **Breavington v Godleman (1988)**: Applied section 118 to issues of conflict of laws between states.

## Section 119 - Protection of States from invasion and violence

**Original Text:**
> The Commonwealth shall protect every State against invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the State, against domestic violence.

**Plain English:**
The Commonwealth must:
1. Protect each state from foreign invasion
2. Protect a state from internal violence if the state government requests it

This section establishes Commonwealth responsibility for defending states against external threats and internal disturbances (upon request).

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 120 - Custody of offenders against laws of the Commonwealth

**Original Text:**
> Every State shall make provision for the detention in its prisons of persons accused or convicted of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth, and for the punishment of persons convicted of such offences, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws to give effect to this provision.

**Plain English:**
States must:
1. Provide prison facilities for people accused or convicted of breaking Commonwealth laws
2. Handle the punishment of people convicted of Commonwealth offenses

The Commonwealth Parliament can make laws to implement this provision.

This section addresses the practical arrangements for detaining and punishing people who break Commonwealth laws.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.
