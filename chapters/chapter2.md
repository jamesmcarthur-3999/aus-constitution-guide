# Chapter II - The Executive Government

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter II of the Australian Constitution establishes the executive branch of the Australian government, which is responsible for implementing and enforcing laws. This chapter covers sections 61-70 and outlines the role and powers of the Governor-General, the Federal Executive Council, and Ministers of State.

### Section 61 - Executive power

**Original Text:**
> The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The power to run the government of Australia belongs to the Queen, but is exercised by the Governor-General acting as the Queen's representative. This power includes implementing and upholding the Constitution and Commonwealth laws.

**Key Cases:**
- **Pape v Commissioner of Taxation (2009)**: The High Court found that section 61 gives the Commonwealth some power to respond to national emergencies (in this case, to provide economic stimulus payments during the Global Financial Crisis), but this power is not unlimited.
- **Williams v Commonwealth (2012)** ("School Chaplains Case"): The High Court clarified that the executive power does not allow the Commonwealth to spend money on programs without parliamentary authorization through legislation, even if the spending is on matters within Commonwealth legislative power.

### Section 62 - Federal Executive Council

**Original Text:**
> There shall be a Federal Executive Council to advise the Governor-General in the government of the Commonwealth, and the members of the Council shall be chosen and summoned by the Governor-General and sworn as Executive Councillors, and shall hold office during his pleasure.

**Plain English:**
A Federal Executive Council will be established to advise the Governor-General on governing Australia. The Governor-General chooses and appoints the members of this Council, who must take an oath as Executive Councillors. Members serve at the Governor-General's discretion.

**Note:** In practice, the Federal Executive Council consists of all current and former Ministers and Assistant Ministers from the governing party or coalition. It provides formal advice to the Governor-General, who usually acts on this advice.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 63 - Provisions referring to Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> The provisions of this Constitution referring to the Governor-General in Council shall be construed as referring to the Governor-General acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council.

**Plain English:**
Whenever the Constitution refers to the "Governor-General in Council," it means the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council. This distinguishes between actions the Governor-General takes personally and those taken based on formal advice from the Council.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 64 - Ministers of State

**Original Text:**
> The Governor-General may appoint officers to administer such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor-General in Council may establish.
>
> Such officers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor-General. They shall be members of the Federal Executive Council, and shall be the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth.
>
> After the first general election no Minister of State shall hold office for a longer period than three months unless he is or becomes a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General can appoint Ministers to run government departments that are established by the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council. These Ministers:
- Serve at the Governor-General's discretion
- Are members of the Federal Executive Council
- Are known as "the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth"

After the first general election, a person can only be a Minister for longer than three months if they are a member of either the Senate or the House of Representatives.

**Key Cases:**
- **Re Canavan (2017)**: While not directly interpreting this section, this case about the eligibility of members of Parliament indirectly affects who can be Ministers, since Ministers must generally be members of Parliament.

### Section 65 - Number of Ministers

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Ministers of State shall not exceed seven in number, and shall hold such offices as the Parliament prescribes, or, in the absence of provision, as the Governor-General directs.

**Plain English:**
Until Parliament decides otherwise, there can be no more than seven Ministers of State. The Ministers will hold the offices (portfolios) that Parliament specifies, or if Parliament hasn't specified them, the offices that the Governor-General decides.

**Note:** Parliament has since provided for a much larger ministry through the Ministers of State Act 1952.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 66 - Salaries of Ministers

**Original Text:**
> There shall be payable to the Queen, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth, for the salaries of the Ministers of State, an annual sum which, until the Parliament otherwise provides, shall not exceed twelve thousand pounds a year.

**Plain English:**
Ministers of State will be paid salaries from the Consolidated Revenue Fund (the government's main account). Until Parliament decides differently, these salaries cannot total more than twelve thousand pounds per year.

**Note:** Parliament has since provided for ministerial salaries through legislation.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 67 - Appointment of civil servants

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the appointment and removal of all other officers of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the Governor-General in Council, unless the appointment is delegated by the Governor-General in Council or by a law of the Commonwealth to some other authority.

**Plain English:**
Until Parliament makes other arrangements, the Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council, has the power to appoint and dismiss all other officers (public servants) of the Commonwealth government. However, this power can be delegated to someone else, either by the Governor-General in Council or by a Commonwealth law.

**Note:** Parliament has since provided for the Australian Public Service through the Public Service Act 1999.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 68 - Command of naval and military forces

**Original Text:**
> The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen's representative.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General, as the Queen's representative, is the commander-in-chief of Australia's navy and army.

**Note:** In practice, the Governor-General's role as commander-in-chief is ceremonial, and operational control of the Australian Defence Force is exercised by the government through the Minister for Defence and military commanders.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 69 - Transfer of certain departments

**Original Text:**
> On a date or dates to be proclaimed by the Governor-General after the establishment of the Commonwealth the following departments of the public service in each State shall become transferred to the Commonwealth:
> 
> Posts, telegraphs, and telephones:
> Naval and military defence:
> Lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys:
> Quarantine.
> 
> But the departments of customs and of excise in each State shall become transferred to the Commonwealth on its establishment.

**Plain English:**
When Australia became a federation, the customs and excise departments of each state were immediately transferred to the Commonwealth government. The Governor-General would later announce dates when the following state departments would also be transferred to the Commonwealth:
- Postal services, telegraphs, and telephones
- Naval and military defense
- Lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys
- Quarantine services

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 70 - Certain powers of Governors to vest in Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> In respect of matters which, under this Constitution, pass to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth, all powers and functions which at the establishment of the Commonwealth are vested in the Governor of a Colony, or in the Governor of a Colony with the advice of his Executive Council, or in any authority of a Colony, shall vest in the Governor-General, or in the Governor-General in Council, or in the authority exercising similar powers under the Commonwealth, as the case requires.

**Plain English:**
For matters that become the responsibility of the Commonwealth government under the Constitution, any powers that were previously held by:
- A state Governor, or
- A state Governor acting on the advice of their Executive Council, or
- Any other state authority

will now be held by:
- The Governor-General, or
- The Governor-General acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council, or
- The Commonwealth authority that performs similar functions.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.
