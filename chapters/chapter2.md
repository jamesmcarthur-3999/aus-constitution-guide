# Chapter II - The Executive Government

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter II of the Australian Constitution establishes the executive branch of the Australian government. The executive branch is responsible for implementing and enforcing laws. This chapter covers sections 61-70 and outlines the structure, powers, and functions of the executive government.

## Section 61 - Executive Power

**Original Text:**
> The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The executive power of Australia belongs to the Queen but is exercised by the Governor-General as her representative. This power includes implementing the Constitution and Commonwealth laws.

**Key Cases:**
- **Pape v Commissioner of Taxation (2009)**: The High Court found that there are limits on the executive power of the Commonwealth. While the executive can implement laws passed by Parliament, it has limited powers to spend money without Parliament's approval.
- **Williams v Commonwealth (2012)** ("School Chaplains Case"): Further restricted executive power, ruling that the Commonwealth Executive generally requires statutory authority (not just appropriation) to spend public money.

## Section 62 - Federal Executive Council

**Original Text:**
> There shall be a Federal Executive Council to advise the Governor-General in the government of the Commonwealth, and the members of the Council shall be chosen and summoned by the Governor-General and sworn as Executive Councillors, and shall hold office during his pleasure.

**Plain English:**
A Federal Executive Council will be established to advise the Governor-General on governing Australia. The Governor-General chooses and appoints members of this Council, who serve as long as the Governor-General wishes.

In practice, the Federal Executive Council is made up of all current and former ministers. The Council's main role is to formally advise the Governor-General to sign regulations, proclamations, and other legal instruments.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 63 - Provisions referring to Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> The provisions of this Constitution referring to the Governor-General in Council shall be construed as referring to the Governor-General acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council.

**Plain English:**
When the Constitution mentions the "Governor-General in Council," it means the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council.

This distinguishes between actions the Governor-General takes on ministerial advice (Governor-General in Council) and actions taken using reserve powers or on non-ministerial advice.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 64 - Ministers of State

**Original Text:**
> The Governor-General may appoint officers to administer such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor-General in Council may establish.
> 
> Such officers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor-General. They shall be members of the Federal Executive Council, and shall be the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth.
> 
> After the first general election no Minister of State shall hold office for a longer period than three months unless he is or becomes a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General can appoint Ministers to run government departments. These Ministers:
- Serve at the Governor-General's pleasure (can be dismissed at any time)
- Must be members of the Federal Executive Council
- Are known as the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth
- Must become members of either the Senate or House of Representatives within three months of being appointed (after the first election)

This section establishes the requirement that Ministers must be members of Parliament, implementing the principle of responsible government.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 65 - Number of Ministers

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Ministers of State shall not exceed seven in number, and shall hold such offices as the Parliament prescribes, or, in the absence of provision, as the Governor-General directs.

**Plain English:**
There shall be no more than seven Ministers of State, unless Parliament changes this number. Parliament can create specific ministerial positions, or the Governor-General can decide what positions to create if Parliament has not specified them.

In practice, Parliament has long since increased the number of Ministers, and there are now typically around 30 Ministers in the Australian Government.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 66 - Salaries of Ministers

**Original Text:**
> There shall be payable to the Queen, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth, for the salaries of the Ministers of State, an annual sum which, until the Parliament otherwise provides, shall not exceed twelve thousand pounds a year.

**Plain English:**
Ministers will be paid salaries from the Consolidated Revenue Fund (the government's main bank account). Initially, the total salaries of all Ministers could not exceed 12,000 pounds per year, but Parliament can change this amount.

Parliament has since passed legislation to determine ministerial salaries and allowances.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 67 - Appointment of civil servants

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the appointment and removal of all other officers of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the Governor-General in Council, unless the appointment is delegated by the Governor-General in Council or by a law of the Commonwealth to some other authority.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General in Council (acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council) can appoint and remove public servants and other government officials. This power can be delegated to other authorities, either by the Governor-General in Council or by Commonwealth law.

Parliament has since passed legislation establishing the Australian Public Service and procedures for appointing and removing public servants.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 68 - Command of naval and military forces

**Original Text:**
> The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen's representative.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General, as the Queen's representative, is the Commander-in-Chief of Australia's navy and military forces.

In practice, the Governor-General exercises this power on the advice of government ministers, particularly the Minister for Defence and the Prime Minister.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 69 - Transfer of certain departments

**Original Text:**
> On a date or dates to be proclaimed by the Governor-General after the establishment of the Commonwealth the following departments of the public service in each State shall become transferred to the Commonwealth:â€”
> 
> Posts, telegraphs, and telephones:
> Naval and military defence:
> Lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys:
> Quarantine.
> 
> But the departments of customs and of excise in each State shall become transferred to the Commonwealth on its establishment.

**Plain English:**
When the Commonwealth of Australia was established, the following government departments were transferred from the states to the federal government:
- Customs and excise departments (transferred immediately)
- Postal services, telegraphs, and telephones (transferred on dates proclaimed by the Governor-General)
- Naval and military defence (transferred on dates proclaimed by the Governor-General)
- Lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys (transferred on dates proclaimed by the Governor-General)
- Quarantine services (transferred on dates proclaimed by the Governor-General)

This section was about the practical transition of certain functions from the colonial/state governments to the new federal government.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

## Section 70 - Certain powers of Governors to vest in Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> In respect of matters which, under this Constitution, pass to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth, all powers and functions which at the establishment of the Commonwealth are vested in the Governor of a Colony, or in the Governor of a Colony with the advice of his Executive Council, or in any authority of a Colony, shall vest in the Governor-General, or in the Governor-General in Council, or in the authority exercising similar powers under the Commonwealth, as the case requires.

**Plain English:**
For all matters that this Constitution transfers to the Commonwealth Executive Government, any powers previously held by:
- A Colonial Governor
- A Colonial Governor acting on advice of the Executive Council
- Any colonial authority

will transfer to:
- The Governor-General
- The Governor-General in Council (acting on advice of the Federal Executive Council)
- The equivalent Commonwealth authority

This section ensured a smooth transition of executive powers from the colonies to the new federal structure.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.
