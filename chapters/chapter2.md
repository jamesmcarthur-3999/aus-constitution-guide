# Chapter II - The Executive Government

## Plain English Explanation

Chapter II of the Australian Constitution establishes the executive branch of the Australian government, which is responsible for implementing and enforcing laws. This chapter includes Sections 61-70.

### Section 61 - Executive power

**Original Text:**
> The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor-General as the Queen's representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth.

**Plain English:**
The executive power of Australia belongs to the Queen but is exercised by the Governor-General as her representative. This power includes carrying out and maintaining the Constitution and Commonwealth laws.

In practice, this section establishes that Australia's executive power is held by the government of the day, headed by the Prime Minister and Cabinet, who advise the Governor-General.

**Key Cases:**
- **Pape v Commissioner of Taxation (2009)**: The High Court found that the executive power under Section 61 is not unlimited and must be exercised in accordance with the Constitution. The case involved the validity of stimulus payments during the global financial crisis.

### Section 62 - Federal Executive Council

**Original Text:**
> There shall be a Federal Executive Council to advise the Governor-General in the government of the Commonwealth, and the members of the Council shall be chosen and summoned by the Governor-General and sworn as Executive Councillors, and shall hold office during his pleasure.

**Plain English:**
There will be a Federal Executive Council to advise the Governor-General. The Governor-General chooses and calls the members of the Council, who take an oath as Executive Councillors and serve at the Governor-General's discretion.

In practice, the Federal Executive Council is made up of all current and former ministers and parliamentary secretaries from the government. However, only current ministers attend meetings.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 63 - Provisions referring to Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> The provisions of this Constitution referring to the Governor-General in Council shall be construed as referring to the Governor-General acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council.

**Plain English:**
Any mention in the Constitution of "the Governor-General in Council" means the Governor-General acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council.

This section distinguishes between the Governor-General's personal powers and those exercised on the advice of the Federal Executive Council.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 64 - Ministers of State

**Original Text:**
> The Governor-General may appoint officers to administer such departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor-General in Council may establish.
> 
> Such officers shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor-General. They shall be members of the Federal Executive Council, and shall be the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth.
> 
> After the first general election no Minister of State shall hold office for a longer period than three months unless he is or becomes a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General can appoint Ministers to administer government departments established by the Governor-General in Council. Ministers serve at the Governor-General's discretion and are members of the Federal Executive Council.

After the first election, a person can only be a Minister for longer than three months if they are or become a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.

This section establishes the principle of responsible government, requiring Ministers to be members of Parliament and therefore accountable to the people's representatives.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 65 - Number of Ministers

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Ministers of State shall not exceed seven in number, and shall hold such offices as the Parliament prescribes, or, in the absence of provision, as the Governor-General directs.

**Plain English:**
Until Parliament decides otherwise, there can be no more than seven Ministers. They will hold the offices that Parliament determines or, if Parliament hasn't specified, that the Governor-General directs.

Parliament has since provided for more than seven Ministers. Today, the number of Ministers is determined by the Prime Minister.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 66 - Salaries of Ministers

**Original Text:**
> There shall be payable to the Queen, out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth, for the salaries of the Ministers of State, an annual sum which, until the Parliament otherwise provides, shall not exceed twelve thousand pounds a year.

**Plain English:**
Ministers' salaries will be paid out of the Commonwealth's main revenue fund. Until Parliament decides otherwise, the total amount for all Ministers' salaries cannot exceed 12,000 pounds per year.

Parliament has since provided for higher salaries. Ministers' salaries are now determined by the Remuneration Tribunal.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 67 - Appointment of civil servants

**Original Text:**
> Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the appointment and removal of all other officers of the Executive Government of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the Governor-General in Council, unless the appointment is delegated by the Governor-General in Council or by a law of the Commonwealth to some other authority.

**Plain English:**
Until Parliament decides otherwise, the Governor-General in Council (acting on advice of the Federal Executive Council) can appoint and remove all other officers of the Commonwealth Executive Government. This power can be delegated to someone else by the Governor-General in Council or by a Commonwealth law.

Parliament has since provided for various appointment procedures for public servants through legislation like the Public Service Act.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 68 - Command of naval and military forces

**Original Text:**
> The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen's representative.

**Plain English:**
The Governor-General, as the Queen's representative, has chief command of Australia's naval and military forces.

In practice, this is a formal power. The actual command of the Australian Defence Force is exercised by the Chief of the Defence Force under the direction of the Minister for Defence and Cabinet.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 69 - Transfer of certain departments

**Original Text:**
> On a date or dates to be proclaimed by the Governor-General after the establishment of the Commonwealth the following departments of the public service in each State shall become transferred to the Commonwealth:
> 
> Posts, telegraphs, and telephones:
> Naval and military defence:
> Lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys:
> Quarantine.
> 
> But the departments of customs and of excise in each State shall become transferred to the Commonwealth on its establishment.

**Plain English:**
After the Commonwealth was established, the following state departments were transferred to the Commonwealth (on dates proclaimed by the Governor-General):
- Postal services, telegraphs, and telephones
- Naval and military defense
- Lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys
- Quarantine

The customs and excise departments in each state were transferred to the Commonwealth immediately upon its establishment.

This section facilitated the transition from colonial administration to federal administration in specific areas.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.

### Section 70 - Certain powers of Governors to vest in Governor-General

**Original Text:**
> In respect of matters which, under this Constitution, pass to the Executive Government of the Commonwealth, all powers and functions which at the establishment of the Commonwealth are vested in the Governor of a Colony, or in the Governor of a Colony with the advice of his Executive Council, or in any authority of a Colony, shall vest in the Governor-General, or in the Governor-General in Council, or in the authority exercising similar powers under the Commonwealth, as the case requires.

**Plain English:**
For matters that become the responsibility of the Commonwealth under the Constitution, all powers and functions previously held by a Colonial Governor, or a Colonial Governor with the advice of their Executive Council, or any colonial authority, will transfer to the equivalent Commonwealth authority. This could be the Governor-General, the Governor-General in Council, or a similar Commonwealth authority, as appropriate.

This section ensured a smooth transfer of executive powers from the colonies to the new federal government.

**Key Cases:**
None specifically interpreting this section.
